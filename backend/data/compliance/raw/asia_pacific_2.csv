Pakistan,PK,Telemarketing to consumers is addressed by PTA directives: consumers can opt out of promotional calls/SMS via the **Do Not Call Register** (since 2010s). Unsolicited marketing without consent is discouraged by the regulator,Opt-out (default allows calls but consumers can **register on DNCR to refuse telemarketing**),No specific B2B telemarketing laws known. B2B communications are generally not restricted (unless personal mobile numbers are targeted),Opt-out (not formally required but advisable to honor requests even in B2B contexts),Do Not Call Register (DNCR),No public website; opt-out via SMS "reg" to 3627 (PTA service),Unknown (Likely no public API; DNCR handled by telecom operators internally),Yes – if a number is on DNCR **it must not be contacted** even if it's your customer,Not officially specified. Common practice is to avoid calling during late night. (No codified quiet hours law but maintaining ~09:00–21:00 calling window is recommended),No specific requirement. (AI or automated calls are generally treated as "telemarketing communication" – presumably must follow same opt-out rules; fully automated calls may be viewed cautiously by PTA),One-party consent (no law prohibiting recording if one party to call). Recording is not widely regulated – but any recorded data should be kept secure. It's polite to inform. **Government may require disclosure if call content is sensitive** (e.g. political),No formal ER exemption. If a customer's number is on DNCR you cannot legally telemarket to them. Companies should maintain internal do-not-call lists as well. Transactional calls to existing customers (e.g. service updates) are allowed,Messages from charities or political campaigns are not explicitly covered by the DNCR (the DNCR is aimed at "telemarketing-related messages"). PTA's focus is on commercial promotions. Also truly "transactional" service calls aren't considered telemarketing. **Note:** Enforcement is via carrier filtering and user complaints so compliance relies on telecom cooperation,No special caller ID or prefix system (unlike India). Telemarketers often use regular mobile or landline numbers; PTA warns operators to curb **SPAM CLI** and allows users to block unknown numbers via *420#. (Product should ensure valid Pakistani numbers are displayed; best practice: use identifiable numbers and avoid frequent number changes),2021: PTA bolstered anti-spam measures – launched *420# blocking service and publicized DNCR opt-out widely. A new personal data protection bill is pending (could require consent for direct marketing if enacted). As of 2025 DNCR remains the main tool.,2025-08-19,2021-01-28,Medium,PTA DNCR Guidelines (EN) PTA Anti-Spam Measures (EN),**Product Note:** Enable **Pakistan DNCR compliance**: do not contact numbers that have opted out via 3627 (telecom operators likely filter such numbers – nonetheless maintain your own list of numbers to avoid). Provide a clear opt-out method in any message or call. It's advisable to get **opt-in consent** especially for bulk campaigns as Pakistan may introduce data protection soon. Limit call times to business hours/local daytime to avoid complaints. Monitor PTA guidelines – they sometimes issue new spam-control directives (e.g. forbidding masking of identities or requiring telemarketer registration). Automated/AI calls should be used sparingly and always include identification and opt-out (to avoid being flagged as spam).
Bangladesh,BD,Unsolicited marketing calls/SMS are discouraged by BTRC. **"Do Not Disturb" (DND) services** exist via mobile operators for consumers to block promos. No specific telemarketing law but general consumer protection against harassment applies,Opt-out (consumer can dial codes to opt out of promotional communications; no nationwide list that telemarketers query – it's handled by carriers),No B2B-specific rules. Telemarketing to businesses is not separately regulated,No formal regime; treat as opt-out if individuals' numbers are used,"Do Not Disturb" service (per carrier per user),N/A (USSD codes per operator: e.g. *121*1101# for GP),No (each mobile operator filters for its subscribers),N/A (if a user has activated DND with their carrier promotions are blocked by the carrier – marketers should exclude those users from campaigns),None defined in law. Calls at night may be considered **nuisance**. Best practice: restrict marketing calls roughly to 09:00–20:00 local time,Not specified. (AI/automated calls are rare; any pre-recorded spam calls would fall under BTRC's anti-spam guidelines but no explicit requirement to label as AI),One-party consent (no specific law requiring dual consent for call recording). Companies should adhere to privacy norms – advise customers if recording. Any personal data collected via calls falls under data protection policy (draft law pending),No explicit ER exemption. **If a customer opts out via their carrier's DND the business must stop promos** to them. Otherwise existing customers can be contacted for similar products *within reasonable bounds* but must stop if they complain. (The draft data protection law is expected to include a right to object to direct marketing),Operators' own marketing messages are subject to DND (and many complaints are about mobile network promo SMS). Government or emergency alerts aren't considered "marketing." Overall **exceptions are minimal** – telemarketing is generally treated uniformly. (**Note:** Enforcement is currently low; compliance relies on customer complaints to BTRC.),No special telemarketer number series. Calls come from normal mobile or landline numbers. BTRC instructs operators to remind users about DND options monthly. CLI spoofing is illegal (general anti-fraud provisions) but no dedicated caller ID rules for telemarketers,2021: BTRC formally launched the DND initiative across all mobile operators. In 2022–2023 draft Data Protection Act was under review (which may introduce consent requirements for using personal contact info). No new dedicated telemarketing law yet.,2025-08-19,2021-04-25,Medium,BTRC DND Guidelines (EN) Draft Data Protection Act (EN),**Product Note:** Rely on Bangladesh's carrier-level DND: if possible **obtain lists or API from carriers to scrub out DND-activated numbers** (currently each operator may handle internally – so as a precaution include an opt-out mechanism in every call/SMS and honor any opt-out request directly). Keep calls to reasonable hours. Be aware spam complaints can lead BTRC to direct operators to cut off your numbers. Aim to get explicit consent from users (e.g. via forms or SMS) before marketing calls especially as data privacy laws evolve. AI calls are not common in BD – if used ensure they clearly identify the business and provide a way to connect to a human or opt out.
Sri Lanka,LK,No specific telemarketing law but **Consumer Affairs Authority Act** and **Data Protection Act 2022** provide general safeguards. Direct marketing using personal data likely requires consent or opportunity to opt out under the new privacy law,Opt-out/Depends (Data Protection Act gives individuals the right to object to direct marketing; companies should honor opt-outs. No national DNC registry),No distinct B2B regulations. Telemarketing targeting businesses is generally permissible. The 2022 privacy law applies only to natural persons' data not to company contacts,Opt-out (if personal data of individuals is used). Pure B2B communications (company lines) face no specific restriction,None (No Do Not Call list in Sri Lanka),N/A,N/A,N/A (must respect individual opt-out requests though per general law),Not codified. Industry practice is to avoid late-night calls. (Telecom self-regulations might advise standard business hours; e.g. 08:00–20:00),Not specifically. (No requirement to announce an AI caller. Automated unsolicited calls would likely fall under "electronic communications" needing consent in DPA but person-to-person AI agent would be unregulated as of now),One-party consent legally (no law requires informing the other party of recording). Still best practice under DPA: inform if recording since it's personal data. Many call centers do play a recording notice for quality compliance,No explicit existing-customer exemption in law. Marketers should obtain consent from customers for marketing or at least give a clear opt-out. (An "existing relationship" alone doesn't override the consumer's rights under general law),If the call is purely informational (not marketing) it's not restricted. Political campaign calls charity calls are not addressed by current laws and generally permissible. The Data Protection Act focuses on **"commercial" use of personal data** – so nonprofit communications may not be affected,No specific caller ID or prefix rules. Telemarketers often use regular phone numbers. The regulator (TRCSL) has addressed call spoofing as part of fraud prevention but not specific to telemarketing. It's good practice to display a number and not withhold CLI,2022: Personal Data Protection Act enacted – effective 2023/24 – introduces obligations for consent and fair processing in direct marketing (first such framework in SL). As of 2025 no dedicated DNC registry or telemarketing-specific regulations have been implemented.,2025-08-19,2022-03-25,Medium,Data Protection Act No. 9 of 2022 (official gazette) (EN),**Product Note:** Implement basic **opt-out handling**: allow Sri Lankan recipients to easily opt out of future calls (and honor that in your system). Given the new privacy law it's safest to use **consent-based marketing** – i.e. call people who have agreed or not objected after notice. Train agents to immediately comply if a person says they don't want marketing. Keep call times to normal hours. Because no official DNC exists err on side of caution: perhaps avoid repeatedly cold-calling non-customers. Keep an eye on any consumer protection updates – if telemarketing nuisances rise regulations could be introduced. AI voice calls should follow the same norms as human calls (clear identification etc.).
Nepal,NP,No specific telemarketing legislation identified. Telemarketing is minimal; any marketing calls must still comply with general consumer protection (avoid harassment) and any applicable privacy principles (Nepal has draft privacy legislation),Opt-out (de facto – since there's no formal regime companies should honor any do-not-call requests from consumers),No B2B telemarketing rules. B2B calls are generally free from regulation in Nepal,Opt-out (no requirement but advisable to apply consumer courtesy to business contacts too),None,N/A,N/A,N/A,None defined. Best practice: restrict calls to daytime/business hours to avoid complaints,Not specified (no known requirement to announce AI usage),One-party consent (Nepal law does not require both parties' consent to record). However recording without a party's knowledge could be viewed negatively if challenged under privacy or wiretap provisions. Safer to inform at least in welcome message,Not applicable (no formal exemption needed as no specific law). If someone you called objects you should mark and avoid calling again as a matter of good practice,N/A – no known exceptions beyond regular practice (e.g. government/public safety calls aren't marketing). Essentially all unsolicited sales calls are tolerated unless they become harassment,No special caller ID rules. Using a recognizable number is recommended. (Nepal Telecom and Ncell have not implemented distinct prefixes for telemarketers),No recent changes. Nepal Telecom Authority has focused on spam SMS control and quality of service. As of 2025 no DNC registry or new telemarketing law.,2025-08-19,N/A,Low,(No official sources found – based on regional comparison and NTA communications),**Product Note:** **No clear legal framework** – proceed conservatively. Always allow recipients to opt out and maintain an internal list of "do-not-call" requests. Limit call frequency to avoid being flagged for nuisance. If Nepal enacts its data protection law (draft pending) expect a consent/opt-out requirement for using personal numbers. Until then apply basic etiquette: identify your company on calls offer a way to decline future calls and stick to local business hours. AI calls: since unregulated ensure they aren't mistaken for scams – perhaps open with a statement and route to human on request.
Bhutan,BT,No known telemarketing-specific laws. Telemarketing is not common; any practices would be governed by general provisions (e.g. Personal Data Law if enacted and consumer protection from harassment),Opt-out (de facto – no formal opt-in regime but companies should stop if individual objects),No B2B rules; B2B calls are fine,Opt-out (courtesy-based),None,N/A,N/A,N/A,None defined. Use common sense (e.g. 09:00–20:00),No,Likely one-party consent (no law prohibiting recording). Mongolia's privacy law is nascent; recording is generally allowed but should be disclosed if content is sensitive,N/A,N/A,No,Mongolia is considering stronger privacy laws but as of 2025 no DNC or telemarketing rules. No changes.,2025-08-19,N/A,Low,(No specific sources – inference from Mongolia's legal environment),**Product Note:** Very little formal guidance. If engaging in telemarketing in Mongolia follow best practices: get prior permission where possible introduce yourself clearly and keep an internal list of anyone who says stop. Given the lack of rules telemarketing could be seen as unusual – a gentle personalized approach is key. Keep volumes low to avoid prompting regulatory attention. AI calls are untested – if used make them sound as natural and polite as possible or prefer live agents.
Maldives,MV,No dedicated telemarketing laws known. Marketing calls would fall under general consumer protection and the new Data Protection Act (2021) which requires consent for processing personal data,Opt-in/Consent likely required for unsolicited marketing under privacy law (Data Protection Act) – though enforcement is nascent,No B2B telemarketing rules. B2B calls are generally unregulated (privacy law covers personal data only),Opt-in not required for pure B2B context (ensure the number isn't personal),None,N/A,N/A,N/A (but companies should maintain opt-out lists in line with global best practices),None codified. Avoid late night calls (common sense; small community norms),Not specified,One-party consent (no specific law against recording if one party is part of call). Best practice to inform at least via IVR that call may be recorded,No formal exemption. Even for existing customers best to get consent or at least ensure they haven't objected (per Data Protection Act requirements for direct marketing),N/A – no documented exceptions. Political campaign calls might be subject to electoral guidelines but no telemarketing rules per se,No known caller ID or prefix requirements. Use a local recognizable number for better response. (Maldives telecom providers do not distinguish telemarketing lines),2021: Data Protection Act came into force – likely covers direct marketing consent (modeled after GDPR). No reports of a DNC registry or new telcom regulations as of 2025.,2025-08-19,2021-07-01,Low,(Data Protection Act 2021 (MV) – unofficial summary),**Product Note:** Given the new privacy law treat Maldives as **opt-in territory**: do not cold-call individuals without prior consent. If calls are made ensure you have a lawful basis (preferably consent). There's no DNC list so manage opt-outs internally. Because the market is small unsolicited calls can cause brand damage quickly. Focus on consent-based outreach (e.g. customers who signed up). AI calls are untested here – use with caution and clearly identify the caller to avoid confusion or hang-ups.
Indonesia,ID,Telemarketing to consumers is subject to **general privacy law (Personal Data Protection Act 2022)** and sectoral regulations (e.g. OJK for financial marketing). No central DNC registry; consent is the emerging norm under the new PDP law,Opt-in (implied by PDP Act – explicit consent is required to use personal data like phone numbers for marketing). Traditionally opt-out in practice (many cold calls happen) but new law leans toward consent,No explicit B2B telemarketing rules; if calling individuals at businesses PDP law still applies to their personal data,No formal regime; in practice B2B marketing calls are common and not specifically regulated but prudent to apply PDP consent if personal info is used,None,N/A,N/A,N/A (must honor individual refusal per PDP – individuals can withdraw consent at any time),No specific legal hours. Generally avoid calling outside 09:00–21:00. (The ICT Ministry could issue guidelines in future),Not yet specified. (No known requirement to identify AI callers; however outright automated robocalls may fall under unwanted communications rules in the EIT Law),One-party consent for recording is generally accepted. However recording and storing call content requires compliance with PDP security requirements. Companies typically inform at the start ("this call will be recorded") especially in finance sector,No explicit ER exemption in law – even existing customers' data cannot be used for new marketing unless it falls under original purpose or you obtain fresh consent. Some tolerance exists if it's a related product but legally safer to treat as no exemption,Certain types of calls are not considered "marketing" – e.g. collection calls purely informational service calls. Those are permitted without consent for that specific purpose. Otherwise little in the way of exceptions; all promotional calls are covered by data protection and consumer laws,No special telemarketer caller IDs. Regulators encourage carriers to label spam calls (via apps or network) but no prefix. Caller ID must not be spoofed (prohibited by law due to fraud concerns),2022: PDP Act enacted – companies must now **have consent** to process personal data for direct marketing. Enforcement is ramping up. No DNC registry introduced yet. OJK in 2023 warned financial institutions against aggressive telemarketing – indicating tighter supervision.,2025-08-19,2022-10-17,Medium,Personal Data Protection Act No.27 of 2022 (ID) (ID) OJK Guidelines (EN),**Product Note:** After Indonesia's PDP law **do not cold-call without prior consent**. You should obtain clear consent (e.g. web form tick box) before calling Indonesian consumers. Maintain proof of consent for each contact. Ensure a privacy notice is given (if calling agents should mention how you got their number). For any call lists you had pre-law consider running a re-consent campaign. Timing: stick to local business hours. Train agents for polite handling – unwanted calls can be reported to Kominfo or Consumer Protection. Use of AI voice: not specifically banned but given low public familiarity it could be poorly received – if used immediately allow option to speak to a human. Keep recordings secure and document consent withdrawal promptly.
Malaysia,MY,Telemarketing to consumers is governed by the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA) – which requires consent (or notice & opt-out) for direct marketing using personal data. No national DNC list but industry self-regulation exists,Opt-in/Opt-out hybrid: PDPA Section 43 gives individuals the right to prevent processing for direct marketing. In practice **consent or at least notification with opt-out** is required before marketing calls,No specific B2B telemarketing law; PDPA does not apply to business contact information used for business purposes (only personal data of individuals),No consent needed for B2B context under PDPA (unless calling someone's personal number). Ethical opt-out if requested,None (no centralized DNC registry; companies rely on PDPA's opt-out rights),N/A,N/A,N/A (must cease if individual opts out with the company per PDPA Sec. 43),No legal hours specified. Industry practice avoids calls before 9am or after 9pm. The Customer Service Code (voluntary) suggests reasonable hours,Not explicitly mandated. (No law requiring AI self-identification. Automated/prerecorded marketing calls would likely fall under PDPA consent requirement similarly),One-party consent. Businesses commonly record calls (for QA) without separate consent allowed under Malaysian law. However since recordings contain personal data PDPA obligates proper notice purpose limitation and security,No special exemption. If someone is an existing customer you still must comply with PDPA notice/consent unless it's *strictly related to the product they bought*. Many companies include a PDPA consent clause in customer forms to cover future marketing,Service-related calls (e.g. appointment reminders) are not "marketing" and are allowed without separate consent. Political and charitable calls are outside PDPA (which covers commercial context). PDPA only applies to personal data – so truly anonymous marketing (cold-calling random numbers without personal info) is a grey area but not common practice,No specific caller ID rules for telemarketers. Usually calls originate from mobile or fixed numbers. The MCMC has encouraged truthful CLI and taken action on scam call CLI spoofing but no dedicated prefix like "+AD" exists. Always display a number; do not spoof,No recent changes specific to telemarketing. PDPA amendments are under discussion (to strengthen enforcement) but not yet passed as of 2025. MCMC has been cracking down on scam calls which indirectly pressures legitimate telemarketers to be more transparent.,2025-08-19,2019-02-01,Medium,PDPA 2010 (EN) PDPA 2010 Sect.43 (EN),**Product Note:** Ensure **PDPA compliance**: you should have either explicit consent or have provided a privacy notice with an opt-out opportunity *before* calling Malaysian individuals. If you haven't your calls could be unlawful. A practical approach is to send an email/SMS asking permission or include consent in web sign-ups. Always allow opt-out (like an internal DNC): if someone says "don't call" mark it and don't call again. Time your calls considerately. Although no formal DNC list the PDPA opt-out right functions similarly – be ready to delete or suppress data of anyone who objects to marketing. Keep call logs to show compliance (in case of complaints to PDPC). AI voice use: permissible but ensure it follows PDPA (the call content is personal data processing); it's wise to have the AI state which company it represents and offer a human fallback.
Singapore,SG,Telemarketing to consumers is tightly regulated by the **Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)** and a robust **Do Not Call (DNC) registry**. Sending telemarketing messages or calls requires checking DNC and including certain disclosures,Opt-out (PDPA's DNC provisions let consumers opt out by registering; senders must **scrub against DNC**. Consent is required if contacting a number on DNC or if not checking DNC),B2B calls are generally exempt from DNC rules **if** purely to business contact numbers for business-related marketing. (PDPA DNC covers messages to Singapore telephone numbers "addressed to individuals"),No opt-in needed for genuine B2B context. **However** if calling a person's mobile (even for business) it's safer to treat under PDPA and check DNC unless you confirm it's not a personal number,**Do Not Call Registry** (covers calls SMS fax),https://www.dnc.gov.sg,Yes (API and bulk lookup available via PDPC),Depends – **Existing relationships do NOT exempt you from DNC checks**. However if you have the individual's clear consent you may send despite DNC (consent overrides DNC),Allowed calling times not set by law (self-regulation suggests reasonable hours like 09:00–21:00). Avoid late night/early morning to comply with general consumer protection (harassment),Yes/Depends – If using a fully automated voice system PDPC guidelines require **clear identification** of sender. No specific requirement to say "I am a bot" but must not deceive. Likely "Depends" (no explicit AI law yet),By law you **must** specify your organization name and contact (either during call or shortly after) for telemarketing. Recording is one-party consent (legal). If recording contains personal data it's governed by PDPA (you must protect it and not misuse). Often companies announce recording for transparency,No general exemption. **Even customer numbers must be checked against DNC unless you have documented consent**. PDPC allows organizations to obtain "express consent" to bypass DNC – e.g. a customer ticking a box "I agree to calls" – which then permits calls even if they're on DNC,Pure service calls (e.g. password reset calls) aren't "telemarketing". Likewise survey or market research calls are excluded if no selling involved. The DNC registry specifically covers marketing of goods/services. Non-commercial and transactional messages are exempt,Caller ID must not be concealed. There's no special prefix but many marketing calls originate from mobile-prefix numbers which recipients often distrust. Under new anti-scam measures telemarketers using overseas routes must use "[+]-prefix" (this is for all overseas calls). Locally the new requirement (2023) is that spoofed local numbers are forbidden – use the number assigned to you. **In short:** use a valid SG number and don't mask CLI,2022: Significant enforcement for DNC violations (fines issued). 2023: Introduction of the "+65" prefix for incoming overseas calls to combat spoofing (affects call presentation). PDPA amendments in 2021 enhanced penalties. No new exemptions; DNC scheme remains largely same since 2014.,2025-08-19,2021-02-01,High,PDPA (EN) PDPC DNC Guidelines (EN) PDPC Advisory Guidelines on DNC Provisions 2021 (EN),**Product Note:** **Must integrate SG's DNC registry**. Before any call or text to a Singapore number check if it's on DNC (unless you've obtained explicit consent within the last *likely* 12 months – PDPC recommends refreshing consent). Maintain records of consent (in case of audit). Include the organization's name and contact in call or immediately after (legal requirement). Ensure caller ID is displayed; ideally use a Singapore number to avoid "[SPAM?]" labeling. If an agent or AI reaches voicemail they should state the organization and callback info to comply with PDPC rules. Timing: stick to local waking hours to avoid "nuisance" interpretations. AI voice usage is allowed but if you use a prerecorded message **provide a way to opt-out (e.g. "press 9 to be removed")** in the call.
Thailand,TH,Telemarketing to consumers is constrained by the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA effective 2022) which requires consent for most direct marketing and consumer protection laws against nuisance. A draft law to establish a DNC registry has been discussed but not yet enacted,Opt-in (PDPA generally requires consent to use personal data for marketing calls unless another legal basis applies which is rare for unsolicited calls),No specific B2B telemarketing law; communications to company contacts are not explicitly regulated (PDPA covers individuals' data only),No formal requirement (tolerated). Still advisable to honor opt-out requests even in B2B context,None (proposed "No-Call" list is not in force yet),N/A,N/A,N/A (must cease contacting any individual who withdraws consent or objects per PDPA rights),No statutory quiet hours. Avoid late-night calls (there have been public complaints pushing authorities to consider time restrictions). Best to stick to ~08:00–20:00,Not explicitly mandated. (No current law on AI caller disclosure. However using automated dialers with recorded messages might fall under spam call rules – regulators have warned against scam robocalls),One-party consent is legal. Call recordings containing personal data must be protected per PDPA. Companies usually notify during the call if recording (to be safe under PDPA's transparency principle),No official ER exemption. A company's existing customer can be called **only if** the call falls under the scope they originally consented to or it's related to an ongoing service. Otherwise need fresh consent. (Marketing to existing customers without prior opt-in is risky under PDPA),Government informational calls (e.g. public health) aren't considered marketing. Apart from that **virtually no exceptions** – any commercial promotion triggers PDPA. The telecom regulator NBTC has separate rules for prize promotion calls/SMS (lottery scams) but those outlaw fraud rather than allow exceptions,No dedicated caller ID rules for telemarketers yet. The National Telecom Commission has encouraged carriers to label spam numbers and introduced a prefix "<ADV>" tag for SMS marketing. For calls new measures in 2023 require telecom operators to display a "Scam warning" on suspicious call numbers. Telemarketers should use numbers registered in their company name; avoid frequent number changes (could be flagged),2022: PDPA fully enforced – companies fined for unsolicited marketing without consent. 2023: Authorities floated creation of a DNC registry and tighter rules after consumer outcry about spam calls – still in progress. Expect more guidance from PDPC on direct marketing in coming years.,2025-08-19,2022-06-01,Medium,PDPA B.E.2562 (2019) (TH) Thai PDPC Guidance (EN summary),**Product Note:** Treat Thailand as **consent-required**. Ensure you have explicit opt-in (e.g. checked box "I agree to be contacted") before cold-calling a Thai individual. Keep proof of consent. Without consent you risk PDPC penalties. Implement internal suppression: if anyone says they didn't consent or asks not to be called stop immediately and log it. Monitor legal developments – a formal DNC list may appear; if so integrate it. Use clearly identified phone numbers (matching your company) for calls – this builds trust and avoids being auto-flagged. AI calls: Use cautiously; Thais have been hit with scam robocalls so an unfamiliar AI voice might be mistaken for a scam. If you do use an AI consider a Thai-language intro that it's an automated call from Company X and offer a human agent option.
Philippines,PH,Telemarketing is subject to the **Data Privacy Act 2012** (which requires consent or at least fair processing notice for direct marketing) and consumer protection rules on unwanted communications. No nationwide DNC registry exists yet,Opt-in (implied by Data Privacy Act – organizations should have consent to use personal info for marketing calls; at minimum an opt-out mechanism must be provided if they rely on legitimate interest),No specific B2B provisions. Marketing to companies is generally unrestricted unless personal data is involved,No formal regime; generally permitted,None,N/A,N/A,N/A (must honor any opt-out request an individual makes – NPC expects companies to keep "do not contact" lists),No official hours in law. The Department of Trade and Industry endorses calling during reasonable hours only. Recommend 09:00–18:00 for cold calls,Not explicitly. (No law forcing AI disclosure. However telesales calls must always identify the company and purpose whether AI or human),One-party consent. Many call centers record without separate consent (allowed). The NPC advises transparency if calls are recorded as voice recordings are personal data. Safer to inform at start for privacy compliance,No explicit ER exemption. If the person didn't opt in being a customer doesn't automatically allow marketing calls. However if they provided their number during a transaction some companies assume "legitimate interest" for similar offers – this is a gray area; NPC would likely favor explicit consent for marketing,Non-commercial calls (surveys political) aren't covered by the marketing consent requirement of DPA. But fraudulent/spoof calls are separately illegal. Otherwise all promotional calls must follow privacy principles,No special telemarketer caller ID rules. Often calls come from mobile numbers. Telecoms have implemented caller ID tagging for spam (some networks show "Spam Likely"). The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) has regulations against caller ID spoofing (to combat scams) but no prefix system for marketing,No major recent changes. A "NO CALL NO TEXT" bill to create a DNC list has been proposed in Congress multiple times (most recently 2023) but not yet passed. NPC continues to issue warnings to companies about unsolicited contact without consent.,2025-08-19,2018-03-00,Medium,Data Privacy Act IRR 2016 (EN) NPC Advisory on Direct Marketing 2017 (EN),**Product Note:** Operate under the assumption of **consent required**. Ideally call only those who have opted in via web forms etc. If you must cold-call ensure you give a proper privacy notice in the call (who you are how you got their number if asked and that they can opt out). Immediately cease calling a number if the person objects – and add it to an internal DNC list. Be mindful the Philippines is very sensitive to scam calls; using an AI voice might confuse people – better to use a live agent for initial contact. Keep call times to business hours. Stay alert for a potential DNC law; if one passes compliance (scrubbing against it) will become mandatory.
Mongolia,MN,No known telemarketing-specific laws. Telemarketing is not common; any practices would be governed by general provisions (e.g. Personal Data Law if enacted and consumer protection from harassment),Opt-out (de facto – no formal opt-in regime but companies should stop if individual objects),No B2B rules; B2B calls are fine,Opt-out (courtesy-based),None,N/A,N/A,N/A,None defined. Use common sense (e.g. 09:00–20:00),No,Likely one-party consent (no law prohibiting recording). Mongolia's privacy law is nascent; recording is generally allowed but should be disclosed if content is sensitive,N/A,N/A,No,Mongolia is considering stronger privacy laws but as of 2025 no DNC or telemarketing rules. No changes.,2025-08-19,N/A,Low,(No specific sources – inference from Mongolia's legal environment),**Product Note:** Very little formal guidance. If engaging in telemarketing in Mongolia follow best practices: get prior permission where possible introduce yourself clearly and keep an internal list of anyone who says stop. Given the lack of rules telemarketing could be seen as unusual – a gentle personalized approach is key. Keep volumes low to avoid prompting regulatory attention. AI calls are untested – if used make them sound as natural and polite as possible or prefer live agents.
