Iceland,IS,B2C: Unsolicited telemarketing prohibited without prior consent (opt-in regime). Calls to consumers require explicit consent unless consumer has opted in in advance,Opt-in,B2B: No specific prohibition on B2B calls found – calls to businesses allowed without prior consent but good practice is to honor objections and comply with personal data rules,Opt-out (no consent law specifically for B2B; must stop if objected),No formal national DNC list (opt-out) – consumers may register a no-contact preference via phone directory or national registry (bannskrá),N/A,Unknown,Depends (generally not since calls require opt-in anyway – no DNC check needed if consent obtained; ensure consent covers any existing-customer outreach),None specified in law (no official quiet-hours rule identified – recommend business hours only),N,Consent (two-party consent required; recording calls without informing other party is prohibited by law),No explicit "existing customer" exemption for calls – all marketing calls need consent unless specifically requested by the consumer,Calls not considered "marketing" (e.g. surveys market research) are exempt from telemarketing consent rules,No special prefix rules. Caller identity must be disclosed; hiding or misrepresenting caller ID is not allowed (general truth-in-calling obligations),Electronic Communications Act 70/2022 strengthened opt-in requirements. No known 2024-specific changes,2025-08-19,Electronic Communications Act 70/2022 (IS) Data Protection Act (IS) Consumer Protection Act (IS),Iceland has a strict opt-in regime for marketing calls. Ensure prior consent is obtained for any automated or live sales calls to consumers. No centralized DNC list – if undertaking cold calls (discouraged) consider informal opt-out lists (e.g. telephone directory flags) and always honor individual objections. AI-driven calls must follow same consent rules; clearly identify your company on calls. Recording requires informing the person and getting consent due to local privacy law.
Norway,NO,B2C: Telemarketing to consumers allowed on an opt-out basis. Consumers can register in the Central Marketing Exclusion Register (Reservasjonsregisteret) to opt out of calls. Marketers must check the register and avoid calling opted-out numbers,Opt-out,B2B: Telemarketing to business contacts is generally permitted without prior consent. Calls to natural persons at businesses are allowed unless the person has opted out with that business or requested no calls,Opt-out (no prior consent required for B2B; must honor individual opt-outs),"Reservasjonsregisteret" – Central Do Not Call opt-out list (administered by Brønnøysund),https://reservasjon.brreg.no,Y (Yes – registry data available via bulk file/SFTP subscription for scrubbing),No (Existing customers/donors are exempt from DNC restrictions – they may be called even if on DNC),09:00–21:00 weekdays (local time); No calls allowed on Saturdays Sundays or public holidays,N,Legitimate_interest (one-party consent is allowed to record calls; notification is recommended – recording without party's knowledge isn't explicitly banned but privacy authorities advise informing),Yes – existing relationships are exempt: Businesses may call their current or recent customers (or donors) even if the number is on the DNC list,Calls for market surveys or polling (non-sales calls) are not covered by telemarketing rules. Charitable and nonprofit orgs calling their own donors are also treated leniently,Caller ID must not be concealed. Norway requires telemarketers to display a valid phone number and identify the caller and source of any obtained contact data. No dedicated prefix but calls from certain number series may be recognized as telemarketing,2018: Stricter rules introduced – written confirmation of offers required and opt-out scope narrowed. No major changes in 2024 rules remain consistent (GDPR enforcement ongoing),2025-08-19,Marketing Control Act (NO) Reservasjonsregisteret (NO) Consumer Protection Act (NO),Norway has an opt-out regime: you can cold-call consumers unless they've registered opt-out. Must scrub calling lists against the Brønnøysund DNC Register (update at least monthly). Observe quiet hours (no calls late evenings or weekends). AI voice calls are treated like any other call – no extra disclosure rule but consent is needed for fully automated dialing. Call recordings can be done under legitimate interest but it's best practice to announce recording to align with privacy expectations. Norway exempts existing customers from DNC but you must still honor any direct opt-out requests.
Cyprus,CY,B2C: Opt-in regime – Unsolicited marketing calls to individuals are prohibited without prior consent. Direct calling for promotion requires the consumer's explicit consent in advance,Opt-in,B2B: No specific prohibition on B2B cold calls in legislation. Generally calls to companies or professionals are allowed without prior consent. Marketers must stop if a business contact objects (implied opt-out),Opt-out (no explicit B2B consent law; must respect any objections),None (No official DNC registry – not needed due to opt-in requirement),N/A,N/A,N/A (Consent is required for any marketing call so the concept of checking a DNC list for existing relationships doesn't arise – existing clients still need valid consent unless falling under a narrow "soft opt-in" for similar products via email/SMS),None specified in law (no published calling-hour restrictions – advisable to avoid early/late calls),N,Consent (all parties' consent required before recording calls – two-party consent rule is observed in Cyprus per privacy law),No broad exemption. (For email/SMS a "soft opt-in" allows existing customer contact for similar products but calls still generally need prior consent.) Existing business relationships do not automatically waive the consent requirement for calls,Pure service or survey calls (not advertising a product) are not treated as marketing and can be made without consent. Emergency or administrative calls are excluded from marketing rules,No special caller ID prefix. Caller must identify themselves and purpose at the start of the call. Hiding caller number is forbidden under general telecom rules,No significant changes in 2024. Current framework derives from Data Protection Law 125(I)/2018 and ePrivacy Directive implementation – enforcement (e.g. fines by Commissioner for unsolicited calls) continues but no new telemarketing laws enacted in 2024,2025-08-19,Data Protection Law 125(I)/2018 (CY) ePrivacy Directive Implementation (CY),Cyprus requires opt-in consent for telemarketing calls – essentially no cold calls to consumers without prior agreement. Ensure you have explicit consent on record for any sales call. There's no DNC list because unsolicited calls are not allowed by default. B2B calls are less regulated but it's prudent to treat business contacts with an opt-out approach and honor objections. Provide a clear identity and purpose on calls. AI-driven calls must likewise have consent. Call recording needs both parties' consent in Cyprus – do not record customers without notifying and obtaining agreement.
Liechtenstein,LI,B2C: Opt-out regime similar to Swiss/EU practice. Telemarketing calls to individuals are allowed unless the person has opted out (e.g. marked with a "Do Not Call" indicator in the phone directory). Cold calls are legal but must cease if consumer's number is flagged or if they object,Opt-out,B2B: No specific B2B telemarketing restrictions noted. Calls to companies or professionals are generally permitted without prior consent. Treat personal numbers at businesses as you would consumer numbers (honor any opt-out markings or requests),Opt-out (allowed without consent; stop if the person objects),No central DNC registry. Consumers rely on phone directory opt-out ("star" listing) or Switzerland's Robinson list to signal no telemarketing,N/A (Opt-out handled via telephone directory and Swiss Robinson list),Unknown (telemarketers must manually scrub against published opt-out lists – no public API; monthly checking of directory/Robinson list is required),No (If a number is on the opt-out list do not call – existing customer relationship does not override a formal opt-out listing. Otherwise an existing customer not on such a list can be called under the usual rules),None codified. (No statutory quiet hours found. Best practice: call only during normal business hours; avoid early morning late evening Sundays),N,Legitimate_interest (one-party consent is generally allowed for call recording; Liechtenstein mirrors Swiss law where participant recording is legal though privacy law requires secure handling of recordings),Implied yes – Calls to current customers are generally allowed even if they haven't expressly consented (considered not "unsolicited" in practice) but if a customer has opted out via directory/Robinson you must not call,Numbers that are ex-directory or unlisted can be called (only published numbers can be "starred" as no-call). Charitable or non-commercial calls are typically outside the scope of "marketing",No special prefix required by law (Switzerland plans distinct prefixes for telemarketing but not yet in Liechtenstein). Caller ID must be visible; blocking or spoofing caller identity is prohibited by general telecom rules,No major changes as of 2024. Liechtenstein aligns with Swiss/UWGs from 2012 which banned calls to starred numbers. Future trends (e.g. potential EU ePrivacy regulation or Swiss opt-in moves) are being monitored but no new national telemarketing laws in 2024,2025-08-19,UWG Implementation (LI) Data Protection Act (LI),Liechtenstein follows an opt-out approach: you can call consumers until they object. Because there's no national DNC list website you must respect the "starred" telephone directory entries indicating no sales calls and consider checking the Swiss Robinson list for cross-border campaigns. Always display a valid number and don't hide caller ID. B2B calls are generally fine. There's no explicit AI call rule but standard consent/opt-out principles apply. Note: Swiss/UWG practices influence Liechtenstein – a trend toward stricter rules (even opt-in) could emerge so maintain a conservative stance.
Monaco,MC,B2C: Opt-out (current) – Monaco has no dedicated telemarketing law yet. Unsolicited consumer calls are allowed by default (following French practice pre-2023) unless the consumer has objected. Many Monaco residents rely on France's Bloctel DNC list to reduce calls but Monaco itself has not implemented an official list,Opt-out,B2B: Allowed – No specific B2B telemarketing regulations in Monaco. Calls to businesses are generally permitted without consent. Standard data protection principles apply (cease if a person requests no further calls),Opt-out (no consent needed to call businesses),None (No national DNC registry as of 2025. Consumers may use France's Bloctel list informally but Monaco hasn't established its own),N/A,N/A,Depends (Monaco currently lacks DNC rules; if/when a regime is introduced it is expected to exempt calls in the context of an existing customer contract as in France but at present this is not codified),None yet. (No formal quiet hours law. By French analogy telemarketing should only occur Mon–Fri 10:00–20:00 and not on weekends but this is not legally enforced in Monaco),N,Consent (recommended. Monaco lacks explicit call recording law but given French influence all parties' consent or at least clear notification is expected before recording calls),N/A (No specific exemption in law because telemarketing is not specifically regulated. In practice ongoing customer relationships are likely treated as less intrusive – any future law will probably allow current-service calls),No known formal exceptions. (Charitable calls and purely informational calls are not distinguished by law yet – however Monaco authorities are concerned primarily with fraudulent or abusive sales calls),No special caller ID or prefix rules in force. Telemarketers should not conceal their number; France's model of using designated prefixes for marketing calls may be adopted in the future,2023–25: Pending changes – In 2025 Monaco's National Council urged the government to enact strong measures against abusive telemarketing. A new law may introduce an opt-in or stricter opt-out system similar to France's 2023 reforms but as of now it's under discussion,2025-08-19,Monaco National Council Resolution (MC) French Bloctel Influence (MC),Monaco currently has minimal telemarketing-specific regulation so an opt-out approach is used de facto. You can call consumers but due to public pressure Monaco will likely adopt stricter rules soon. It's advisable to apply French standards: scrub against the Bloctel DNC list (even though not legally required) and follow French calling hours. Always display a caller ID. Be especially careful to avoid aggressive or scam-like practices as Monaco is scrutinizing telemarketing and preparing new regulations.
San Marino,SM,B2C: Likely opt-out (no evidence of an opt-in law). San Marino law doesn't explicitly address telemarketing calls; by default unsolicited calls are allowed until the individual objects. It's safe to mirror EU/Italian practices: assume consumers haven't consented unless they opt out via a service,Opt-out (by default),B2B: Allowed – No specific prohibition on B2B telemarketing. Calls to organizations or professionals are permissible without prior consent. Standard rule: stop if the business or contact objects,Opt-out,None specifically for San Marino. Residents likely rely on Italy's Registro Pubblico delle Opposizioni (public opt-out register) to block calls though SM numbers are outside its formal scope,N/A,N/A,N/A (no San Marino DNC to check; if using Italian RPO data note that existing customers in Italy's regime can still be called under "soft opt-in" but this is not codified in SM),None codified. (Follow Italian norms: Italy now bans marketing calls outside 09:00–21:00 on weekdays and 10:00–19:00 on Sat no Sun calls – prudent to apply similar limits),N,Consent (recommended. No explicit SM law on recording calls but given EU/GDPR alignment inform and obtain consent before recording to be safe),Not defined in law. (In practice treating existing client calls as less restricted is reasonable – e.g. service calls or upsells to current customers are generally acceptable unless they opted out),No specific exemptions known. Non-commercial calls (e.g. purely informational calls satisfaction surveys) would not fall under "marketing" and thus face no special rule,No local caller ID rules. It's advisable to show a valid number and follow Italy's lead on prefix usage (Italy now assigns special prefixes for telemarketing calls) to avoid call blocking,San Marino has no recent telemarketing reforms of its own. However Italy's 2022–2023 measures (extending DNC to mobile introducing call prefixes) influence best practices. SM is expected to align informally but no new law in 2024,2025-08-19,Law 171/2018 (SM) Italian RPO Influence (IT context),Note: San Marino's framework is derived from general privacy law (Law 171/2018) rather than telemarketing-specific statutes. In absence of local rules we apply EU/Italian standards. Treat all cold calls with an opt-out mentality – e.g. integrate Italy's RPO list if possible to avoid calling those who opted out in Italy. Limit call times to reasonable hours. No special compliance for AI calls beyond obtaining consent if using automated dialing/voices. For recording get the person's consent or notification to stay within privacy norms.
Andorra,AND,B2C: Opt-out (assumed) – Andorra has no dedicated telemarketing law publicly available. Direct marketing falls under data protection rules. Unsolicited calls to consumers appear to be allowed unless the person has objected (no prior consent mandate is documented). It is prudent to obtain consent when feasible given GDPR-like principles,Opt-out (implicit),B2B: Allowed – No special B2B telemarketing regulations found. Cold calls to businesses are generally acceptable. Treat personal data of contacts in line with legitimate interest and honor any request to stop,Opt-out,None. (No known Andorran DNC registry.),N/A,N/A,N/A (No registry to check; existing customer contacts can be called but ensure compliance with general data law – provide opt-out in each call),None specified. (No legal quiet-hours rules found in Andorra. As a best practice restrict calls to standard local business hours.),N,Legitimate_interest (likely one-party consent is sufficient to record calls – Andorran law doesn't prohibit a participant from recording. However recordings must meet personal data security requirements),Not codified. (By general practice you may call recent customers for related offerings – ensure you gave them an opt-out option at data collection.),No explicit exceptions known. Genuine non-sales calls (e.g. debt collection fraud alerts surveys) are outside marketing scope and not restricted,No specific caller ID or prefix rules. Do not hide your number; follow standard telecom norms (Andorran numbers use +376 code – no special telemarketing prefix in use),No notable changes in 2024. Andorra's new Data Protection Law 29/2021 aligns with GDPR but no update on call-specific rules. Telemarketing practices remain governed by general privacy and consumer fair practice rules,2025-08-19,(No direct sources – inferred from general law) Data Protection Law 29/2021 (AND) Consumer Protection Act (AND),Andorra's telemarketing regime is inferred from its general data protection and consumer laws. There is no formal opt-in requirement for calls so an opt-out approach applies. Always offer the recipient an easy way to refuse future calls. Because there's no DNC list maintain an internal do-not-call list for Andorra. Adhere to GDPR principles: you should have a legitimate interest basis for cold calls and must stop if the person objects. No special rules for AI voices or call recording beyond standard privacy obligations – if recording calls announce it and secure consent to be safe. Given the lack of explicit laws err on the side of caution and transparency in all telemarketing activities.
