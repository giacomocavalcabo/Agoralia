China,CN,Telemarketing to consumers is regulated under consumer protection advertising and data privacy laws; prior consent is generally required,Opt-in (explicit consent required for marketing calls),No explicit B2B telemarketing law; personal data laws still apply if individuals are called,No specific opt-in law for B2B (treat as opt-in to be safe if personal data),"Refuse Call" Platform (谢绝来电平台) (pilot national DNC),Carrier portals (e.g. donotcall.189.cn by China Telecom),Yes (Bulk/API via carrier systems),Yes (consent still required despite any prior relationship),Not formally codified; generally avoid late-night/early-morning (calls typically 08:00–21:00),Not explicitly mandated (deepfake media must be labeled but no specific rule for AI calls),One-party consent permitted by law; PIPL requires informing individuals (best practice to announce recording),No exemption – even existing customers must have consent or be given opt-out; no automatic bypass of DNC or consent laws,Non-commercial calls (e.g. pure surveys charitable) not covered by advertising law; harassment/fraud calls are separately illegal,Valid caller ID required; no spoofing. **95**-prefix numbers banned for telemarketing use; carriers mark international calls with "+" or country code,2022 Anti-Telecom Fraud Law enforced strict caller ID rules; MIIT moving to implement nationwide Refuse Call registry (2023–2024 pilot),2025-08-19,2020-09-03,Low,Consumer Protection Law (ZH) Advertising Law (ZH) PIPL (ZH),**Product Note:** Treat all cold calls as consent-based. Implement an **opt-in only** model for Chinese consumer numbers. Integrate with carrier "Refuse Call" flags once available. Enforce internal DNC lists and avoid off-hours calls. Ensure a real (licensed) caller number is displayed (no "95" short-codes for marketing). Recording okay with notice. No explicit AI disclosure law yet but transparency is advisable.
Japan,JP,Telemarketing sales to consumers are governed by the Specified Commercial Transactions Act (for "Telephone Solicitation Sales") and privacy laws; unsolicited calls are allowed but tightly regulated,Opt-out (no blanket DNC; consumers can refuse during call; consent needed for certain data use),No special B2B telemarketing law (Act covers consumers only); general business marketing is largely unregulated aside from personal data rules,No consent requirement for pure B2B context (if no personal data); **However calls to individuals at work may invoke personal data rules**,None (No national DNC registry for voice calls),N/A,N/A,N/A (but companies must honor individual opt-out requests promptly),Not explicitly set by law; **calls during late night/early morning are considered nuisance** and prohibited as "improper solicitation". Industry practice: avoid calls before 08:00 or after 21:00,Not specified (no legal requirement to state AI usage),No law requiring two-party consent; one-party recording is lawful. **However if recording contains personal data privacy law (APPI) expects notice/purpose disclosure**,If consumer indicates refusal or hangs up seller **must not call again**. Existing customers are not exempt – they must have been notified and not opted out under APPI,Charities and political calls are mostly outside the Act (Act focuses on sales contracts). Cooling-off: consumers have 8-day contract cancellation right for phone sales,Telemarketer must **display a valid caller number** (no blocking); must immediately state identity & purpose at call start. No special prefix required (unlike some countries),2022: Enforcement notice clarified **night calls are forbidden** as "improper" under the law (effectively banning calls after ~9pm). No DNC registry introduced yet (2019 proposal stalled),2025-08-19,2022-04-01,Medium,Specified Commercial Transactions Act (EN) APPI (EN) Consumer Affairs Agency Guidelines (JA),**Product Note:** No national DNC list – but **internal opt-out** is mandatory. System should allow agents to instantly mark a number as "do-not-call" if the person refuses and no further calls to that consumer. Avoid calling outside 8am–9pm local time. Ensure caller ID is shown and agents give a proper intro. Recording okay (one-party consent) but best practice is to inform ("this call may be recorded…"). AI voices can be used; no disclosure rule but do not mislead or impersonate a human. Provide an opt-out mechanism during any automated call to comply with fair practice.
South Korea,KR,Telemarketing to consumers is highly regulated (Opt-out registry under **Door-to-Door Sales Act** covers telemarketing); **PIPA privacy law** also requires prior consent for marketing use of personal data,Opt-in effectively required – **prior consent** needed for marketing calls; consumers can opt out via DNC registry,No dedicated B2B telemarketing law; **if personal data of individuals (e.g. employee mobiles) is used PIPA consent rules apply**. Pure B2B (company main lines) is generally unregulated,No formal opt-in/out for B2B but prudent to treat as opt-out if individuals' data is involved,National Do-Not-Call Registry (두낫콜),https://www.donotcall.go.kr,Yes (Web portal with bulk upload/query),Yes – no exemption for existing customers on DNC (they must still not be called if opted-out),No specific legal hours but **industry guidelines advise against early morning or late night calls**. Common practice: 09:00–20:00 for marketing calls,Depends/Not specified – no explicit AI/robot call disclosure law. (Automated calling without human is restricted; must reveal caller's identity regardless),One-party consent legal for recording. Financial marketing calls **must** be recorded and kept (per sector rules). Generally inform customer as courtesy,No broad ER exemption. **If number is on DNC you cannot call even if they are a customer**. However if a customer gave explicit consent for certain calls that consent overrides DNC for those calls,Pure service or transactional calls (e.g. flight cancellation notices) are not "marketing" and not subject to DNC. **Political or survey calls** are outside telemarketing law. Telemarketing rules apply only to sales/advertising calls,Caller ID must not be spoofed; **telemarketers must use a valid number** and cannot hide it. No special prefix by law but calls often flagged "Advertisement" on phones. (Carriers block masked/spoofed calls under Telecom Act),2023: Amendments to privacy law clarified need for **explicit consent** for cross-border data in call centers. No major new telemarketing laws post-2016 DNC expansion. Regulators exploring stricter robocall measures with caller-ID authentication (STIR/SHAKEN),2025-08-19,2025-03-29,High,KFTC DNC Registry (EN) PIPA (EN) Door-to-Door Sales Act (EN),**Product Note:** Must integrate with the **KFTC DNC registry** – before dialing any KR consumer number check against donotcall.go.kr (API available). Ensure **prior consent** is obtained for marketing calls (document it). Provide disclosure of data source upon request (Korean law requires telling the person how you got their number). Dial only within standard hours (8am–9pm local). Use only approved phone numbers (get a 140-type telemarketing number if available in KR). Recording can be enabled (one-party consent) and is required if selling insurance/financial products – so have recording on for those campaigns.
Hong Kong,HK,Direct marketing calls to consumers are governed by the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO) – marketers must notify individuals and honor opt-out requests. No blanket DNC for live calls (P2P) yet,Opt-out (PDPO requires giving notice & opportunity to refuse before using personal data for marketing),No specific B2B telemarketing regulations (focus is on consumer personal data). Calls purely to businesses are generally permissible,No consent required strictly for B2B context (unless personal data of individual is used). Follow consumer rules if targeting individual employees,**Do-Not-Call Registers** (fax SMS pre-recorded calls only),https://www.ofca.gov.hk/en/.../public_info_dnc/index.html,Yes (for SMS/Fax/Recorded: via OFCA's system),**Depends** – Existing relationship doesn't waive PDPO requirements. If person opted out or is on a DNC for recordings/SMS must not contact. For P2P calls no central DNC but if customer previously opted out with your company you must honor that,Not legally specified. Industry self-regulation codes suggest reasonable hours (e.g. avoid very late calls). **No formal quiet hours law for live calls**,Not specifically required. (No law forcing disclosure of AI use in calls.) If using pre-recorded message calls must identify the caller and include an unsubscribe facility,One-party consent is legal (no explicit law against recording if one party consents). Common practice is to announce recording for transparency. PDPO: call recordings containing personal data must be handled per privacy principles,No blanket ER exemption in PDPO – even existing customers had to be informed and given opt-out chance before marketing. **However** service-related calls (not marketing new products) are allowed. Existing customers who haven't opted out can be called but must stop if they opt out,Charity solicitations and purely service calls are not "direct marketing" under PDPO. **Unsolicited recorded calls faxes SMS** are covered by UEMO (with DNC lists) but live person-to-person calls are currently unregulated by UEMO. Enforcement of marketing rules is relatively light but PCPD can prosecute serious PDPO breaches,No special caller ID rules for telemarketing yet (proposed law would ban hiding number). It's best practice to display a valid Hong Kong number and identify the organization during the call. (Since 2015 incoming overseas calls show "+" prefix to help identify scams),**Pending**: Legislation was proposed (2019) to create a P2P DNC registry with fines for violations but as of 2025 it has not been enacted. Privacy law update in 2023 did not directly change telemarketing rules.,2025-08-19,2022-06-08,Medium,PDPO (EN) OFCA DNC Guidelines (EN) PCPD Direct Marketing Guidelines (EN),**Product Note:** No universal DNC for live calls yet but **do NOT cold-call HK numbers without prior PDPO compliance**. Ensure you have either (a) the person's consent or (b) have given them a PDPO notice and an opportunity to opt out (e.g. via email/SMS) before calling. Maintain an internal DNC list per PDPO (if someone says "don't call me again" record and honor that). Avoid call attempts at night (common courtesy; industry practice is roughly 9am–9pm). Monitor legislative developments – a P2P DNC registry could become law; if it does integrate it immediately. AI voice calls can be used but **do not conceal identity** – start with a clear introduction as required.
Taiwan,TW,Telemarketing to consumers is subject to **Fair Trade Act/Consumer Protection** rules and Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). Unsolicited calls are allowed but with strict conduct requirements,Opt-out regime (callers need not have prior consent in all cases but must stop on request; PDPA gives right to object to marketing),No dedicated B2B telemarketing law; if personal data of a person is used (e.g. calling an individual's mobile for business) PDPA's opt-out and notice requirements apply,No explicit opt-in needed for B2B. **Conservatively treat as opt-out: honor any refusal from business contacts**,None (No national DNC list; instead an **"internal opt-out"** system mandated by law),N/A,N/A,N/A (but **telemarketers must maintain their own do-not-call list**: once a consumer says stop they cannot call again),No fixed hours in law. However calling **late at night or very early** would likely be deemed an "improper nuisance" under Fair Trade guidelines. Most companies restrict calls roughly to 09:00–21:00,Not specifically required by law,One-party consent. **If a sale is concluded by phone seller must record and keep the call record at least 6 months as part of the contract**. Generally recording without announcement is legal but advising the customer is recommended for trust,No exemption for existing customers – at the first call PDPA Article 20(3) requires giving them a way to opt out of further marketing. If they opt out (or said "no" in a prior call) you cannot call again,Certain sectors (e.g. finance) have specific rules: banks must stop marketing if customer says so (regulated by financial authorities). Also **7-day cooling-off** period applies to purchases made via telemarketing (distance sale),Caller ID **must be displayed** – hiding number is forbidden by regulation. Telemarketers must immediately identify themselves and purpose on call start. No special prefix but consumers can verify numbers via anti-scam apps or 165 hotline,2023: New Digital Communications Act under discussion (to strengthen spam call regulation details TBD). No major changes since earlier Fair Trade guidelines. Taiwan's PDPA (2015) "do-not-call" provisions remain in effect giving individuals the right to reject marketing,2025-08-19,2023-03-02,Medium,Fair Trade Act (ZH) PDPA (ZH) Consumer Protection Act (ZH),**Product Note:** Implement **per-number opt-out tracking**. Agents/scripts must inform consumers of the sales intent and **stop immediately if the consumer expresses disinterest**. Configure dialer to block any number that opted out ("拒絕行銷"). Ensure caller ID is never withheld. Allow call recording especially to capture the agreement for any sale (required to keep as proof). AI calls are not explicitly regulated but all the same rules (identification opt-out option etc.) apply. Err on the side of consent: consider obtaining explicit opt-in for marketing calls when possible due to PDPA's privacy expectations.
India,IN,Telemarketing to consumers is strictly regulated by TRAI's **Telecom Commercial Communications (Unsolicited Commercial Communications) rules**; prior customer consent and DND compliance are required,Opt-out (Default opt-out via National DND registry; can only call if number not on DND or consumer opted in to your messages),No separate B2B telemarketing law (the UCC regulations apply to calls/messages to subscribers mainly consumers). B2B calls are generally allowed if not to personal numbers,No special opt-in needed for B2B but **if using personal mobile numbers of business contacts treat under consumer rules**,National Customer Preference Register (NCPR) a.k.a. **"Do Not Disturb" registry**,https://www.nccptrai.gov.in (TRAI DND portal),Yes (Registered telemarketers get API/portal access for scrubbing),Yes – **existing relationship does NOT exempt calling a DND-listed number** (unless explicit recent consent obtained separately),**Yes – promotional calls & SMS banned 21:00–09:00** by law. (No marketing calls during the night; only transactional/emergency msgs allowed),Not explicitly about AI. **Automated/prerecorded marketing calls require prior consent** under TRAI rules (treated as promotional calls). No specific disclosure mandated beyond identifying the caller and offering opt-out (e.g. key-press to unsubscribe),Call recording is legal (one-party consent). Many call centers record calls under "service/legitimate interest." No law forces prior consent for recording but disclosing "this call is recorded" is good practice. (Sensitive data recording would invoke data protection obligations under DPDPA),No general ER exemption. **Even if the person is a recent customer you cannot bypass DND rules**. TRAI allows exceptions only if the user has themselves toggled categories to receive certain calls (or given explicit consent via verified means),Transactional calls (order confirmations delivery info) are exempt from "commercial communication" rules if purely service and not promotional. Certain sectors use **promotional category preferences** (e.g. a user might allow bank-related promos but block others). Political survey calls are not covered by TRAI's telemarketing rules but may be subject to Election Commission codes,**Must use designated telemarketer numbers (140xx series)** for all outbound marketing calls. CLI cannot be spoofed; using personal/mobile SIMs for telemarketing is illegal (telcos will disconnect unregistered sources on complaint). All marketing SMS must use registered sender IDs and templates,2023: **Digital Personal Data Protection Act** passed – requires clear consent for using personal data (likely tightening requirements for sharing phone lists). 2022-2024: TRAI implementing blockchain-based consent and header systems (DLT) for messaging; similar tightening for voice may follow. No major changes to call time/DND rules (last overhauled in 2018).,2025-08-19,2025-03-29,High,TRAI UCC Rules (EN) NCPR Portal (EN) DPDPA 2023 (EN),**Product Note:** **Absolutely integrate the DND list**: scrub every outbound number against India's NCPR. Only dial via registered telemarketer IDs and on **140xx numbers**. Enforce time-of-day rules (no promotional dialing between 9pm–9am India time). Implement category-based opt-outs if applicable (TRAI allows users to opt in to some categories and out of others). Obtain express consent (digitally or in writing) for any automated or bulk calling campaigns – TRAI mandates recent (within 3 months) consent for commercial calls. Recording calls isn't mandated but keep logs and recordings of consent where possible (for compliance defense). AI voice agents can be used but they must follow all rules: use approved caller ID state the business identity at start and include an opt-out (e.g. "Press 9 to unsubscribe") in the script.
