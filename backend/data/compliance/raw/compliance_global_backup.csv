Asia,China,CN,Telemarketing to consumers is regulated under consumer protection advertising and data privacy laws; prior consent is generally required,Opt-in (explicit consent required for marketing calls),No explicit B2B telemarketing law; personal data laws still apply if individuals are called,No specific opt-in law for B2B (treat as opt-in to be safe if personal data),"Refuse Call" Platform (谢绝来电平台) (pilot national DNC),Carrier portals (e.g. donotcall.189.cn by China Telecom),Yes (Bulk/API via carrier systems),Yes (consent still required despite any prior relationship),Not formally codified; generally avoid late-night/early-morning (calls typically 08:00–21:00),Not explicitly mandated (deepfake media must be labeled but no specific rule for AI calls),One-party consent permitted by law; PIPL requires informing individuals (best practice to announce recording),No exemption – even existing customers must have consent or be given opt-out; no automatic bypass of DNC or consent laws,Non-commercial calls (e.g. pure surveys charitable) not covered by advertising law; harassment/fraud calls are separately illegal,Valid caller ID required; no spoofing. **95**-prefix numbers banned for telemarketing use; carriers mark international calls with "+" or country code,2022 Anti-Telecom Fraud Law enforced strict caller ID rules; MIIT moving to implement nationwide Refuse Call registry (2023–2024 pilot),2025-08-19,2020-09-03,Low,Consumer Protection Law (ZH) Advertising Law (ZH) PIPL (ZH),**Product Note:** Treat all cold calls as consent-based. Implement an **opt-in only** model for Chinese consumer numbers. Integrate with carrier "Refuse Call" flags once available. Enforce internal DNC lists and avoid off-hours calls. Ensure a real (licensed) caller number is displayed (no "95" short-codes for marketing). Recording okay with notice. No explicit AI disclosure law yet but transparency is advisable.
Asia,Japan,JP,Telemarketing sales to consumers are governed by the Specified Commercial Transactions Act (for "Telephone Solicitation Sales") and privacy laws; unsolicited calls are allowed but tightly regulated,Opt-out (no blanket DNC; consumers can refuse during call; consent needed for certain data use),No special B2B telemarketing law (Act covers consumers only); general business marketing is largely unregulated aside from personal data rules,No consent requirement for pure B2B context (if no personal data); **However calls to individuals at work may invoke personal data rules**,None (No national DNC registry for voice calls),N/A,N/A,N/A (but companies must honor individual opt-out requests promptly),Not explicitly set by law; **calls during late night/early morning are considered nuisance** and prohibited as "improper solicitation". Industry practice: avoid calls before 08:00 or after 21:00,Not specified (no legal requirement to state AI usage),No law requiring two-party consent; one-party recording is lawful. **However if recording contains personal data privacy law (APPI) expects notice/purpose disclosure**,If consumer indicates refusal or hangs up seller **must not call again**. Existing customers are not exempt – they must have been notified and not opted out under APPI,Charities and political calls are mostly outside the Act (Act focuses on sales contracts). Cooling-off: consumers have 8-day contract cancellation right for phone sales,Telemarketer must **display a valid caller number** (no blocking); must immediately state identity & purpose at call start. No special prefix required (unlike some countries),2022: Enforcement notice clarified **night calls are forbidden** as "improper" under the law (effectively banning calls after ~9pm). No DNC registry introduced yet (2019 proposal stalled),2025-08-19,2022-04-01,Medium,Specified Commercial Transactions Act (EN) APPI (EN) Consumer Affairs Agency Guidelines (JA),**Product Note:** No national DNC list – but **internal opt-out** is mandatory. System should allow agents to instantly mark a number as "do-not-call" if the person refuses and no further calls to that consumer. Avoid calling outside 8am–9pm local time. Ensure caller ID is shown and agents give a proper intro. Recording okay (one-party consent) but best practice is to inform ("this call may be recorded…"). AI voices can be used; no disclosure rule but do not mislead or impersonate a human. Provide an opt-out mechanism during any automated call to comply with fair practice.
Asia,South Korea,KR,Telemarketing to consumers is highly regulated (Opt-out registry under **Door-to-Door Sales Act** covers telemarketing); **PIPA privacy law** also requires prior consent for marketing use of personal data,Opt-in effectively required – **prior consent** needed for marketing calls; consumers can opt out via DNC registry,No dedicated B2B telemarketing law; **if personal data of individuals (e.g. employee mobiles) is used PIPA consent rules apply**. Pure B2B (company main lines) is generally unregulated,No formal opt-in/out for B2B but prudent to treat as opt-out if individuals' data is involved,National Do-Not-Call Registry (두낫콜),https://www.donotcall.go.kr,Yes (Web portal with bulk upload/query),Yes – no exemption for existing customers on DNC (they must still not be called if opted-out),No specific legal hours but **industry guidelines advise against early morning or late night calls**. Common practice: 09:00–20:00 for marketing calls,Depends/Not specified – no explicit AI/robot call disclosure law. (Automated calling without human is restricted; must reveal caller's identity regardless),One-party consent legal for recording. Financial marketing calls **must** be recorded and kept (per sector rules). Generally inform customer as courtesy,No broad ER exemption. **If number is on DNC you cannot call even if they are a customer**. However if a customer gave explicit consent for certain calls that consent overrides DNC for those calls,Pure service or transactional calls (e.g. flight cancellation notices) are not "marketing" and not subject to DNC. **Political or survey calls** are outside telemarketing law. Telemarketing rules apply only to sales/advertising calls,Caller ID must not be spoofed; **telemarketers must use a valid number** and cannot hide it. No special prefix by law but calls often flagged "Advertisement" on phones. (Carriers block masked/spoofed calls under Telecom Act),2023: Amendments to privacy law clarified need for **explicit consent** for cross-border data in call centers. No major new telemarketing laws post-2016 DNC expansion. Regulators exploring stricter robocall measures with caller-ID authentication (STIR/SHAKEN),2025-08-19,2025-03-29,High,KFTC DNC Registry (EN) PIPA (EN) Door-to-Door Sales Act (EN),**Product Note:** Must integrate with the **KFTC DNC registry** – before dialing any KR consumer number check against donotcall.go.kr (API available). Ensure **prior consent** is obtained for marketing calls (document it). Provide disclosure of data source upon request (Korean law requires telling the person how you got their number). Dial only within standard hours (8am–9pm local). Use only approved phone numbers (get a 140-type telemarketing number if available in KR). Recording can be enabled (one-party consent) and is required if selling insurance/financial products – so have recording on for those campaigns.
Asia,Hong Kong,HK,Direct marketing calls to consumers are governed by the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO) – marketers must notify individuals and honor opt-out requests. No blanket DNC for live calls (P2P) yet,Opt-out (PDPO requires giving notice & opportunity to refuse before using personal data for marketing),No specific B2B telemarketing regulations (focus is on consumer personal data). Calls purely to businesses are generally permissible,No consent required strictly for B2B context (unless personal data of individual is used). Follow consumer rules if targeting individual employees,**Do-Not-Call Registers** (fax SMS pre-recorded calls only),https://www.ofca.gov.hk/en/.../public_info_dnc/index.html,Yes (for SMS/Fax/Recorded: via OFCA's system),**Depends** – Existing relationship doesn't waive PDPO requirements. If person opted out or is on a DNC for recordings/SMS must not contact. For P2P calls no central DNC but if customer previously opted out with your company you must honor that,Not legally specified. Industry self-regulation codes suggest reasonable hours (e.g. avoid very late calls). **No formal quiet hours law for live calls**,Not specifically required. (No law forcing disclosure of AI use in calls.) If using pre-recorded message calls must identify the caller and include an unsubscribe facility,One-party consent is legal (no explicit law against recording if one party consents). Common practice is to announce recording for transparency. PDPO: call recordings containing personal data must be handled per privacy principles,No blanket ER exemption in PDPO – even existing customers had to be informed and given opt-out chance before marketing. **However** service-related calls (not marketing new products) are allowed. Existing customers who haven't opted out can be called but must stop if they opt out,Charity solicitations and purely service calls are not "direct marketing" under PDPO. **Unsolicited recorded calls faxes SMS** are covered by UEMO (with DNC lists) but live person-to-person calls are currently unregulated by UEMO. Enforcement of marketing rules is relatively light but PCPD can prosecute serious PDPO breaches,No special caller ID rules for telemarketing yet (proposed law would ban hiding number). It's best practice to display a valid Hong Kong number and identify the organization during the call. (Since 2015 incoming overseas calls show "+" prefix to help identify scams),**Pending**: Legislation was proposed (2019) to create a P2P DNC registry with fines for violations but as of 2025 it has not been enacted. Privacy law update in 2023 did not directly change telemarketing rules.,2025-08-19,2022-06-08,Medium,PDPO (EN) OFCA DNC Guidelines (EN) PCPD Direct Marketing Guidelines (EN),**Product Note:** No universal DNC for live calls yet but **do NOT cold-call HK numbers without prior PDPO compliance**. Ensure you have either (a) the person's consent or (b) have given them a PDPO notice and an opportunity to opt out (e.g. via email/SMS) before calling. Maintain an internal DNC list per PDPO (if someone says "don't call me again" record and honor that). Avoid call attempts at night (common courtesy; industry practice is roughly 9am–9pm). Monitor legislative developments – a P2P DNC registry could become law; if it does integrate it immediately. AI voice calls can be used but **do not conceal identity** – start with a clear introduction as required.
Asia,Taiwan,TW,Telemarketing to consumers is subject to **Fair Trade Act/Consumer Protection** rules and Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). Unsolicited calls are allowed but with strict conduct requirements,Opt-out regime (callers need not have prior consent in all cases but must stop on request; PDPA gives right to object to marketing),No dedicated B2B telemarketing law; if personal data of a person is used (e.g. calling an individual's mobile for business) PDPA's opt-out and notice requirements apply,No explicit opt-in needed for B2B. **Conservatively treat as opt-out: honor any refusal from business contacts**,None (No national DNC list; instead an **"internal opt-out"** system mandated by law),N/A,N/A,N/A (but **telemarketers must maintain their own do-not-call list**: once a consumer says stop they cannot call again),No fixed hours in law. However calling **late at night or very early** would likely be deemed an "improper nuisance" under Fair Trade guidelines. Most companies restrict calls roughly to 09:00–21:00,Not specifically required by law,One-party consent. **If a sale is concluded by phone seller must record and keep the call record at least 6 months as part of the contract**. Generally recording without announcement is legal but advising the customer is recommended for trust,No exemption for existing customers – at the first call PDPA Article 20(3) requires giving them a way to opt out of further marketing. If they opt out (or said "no" in a prior call) you cannot call again,Certain sectors (e.g. finance) have specific rules: banks must stop marketing if customer says so (regulated by financial authorities). Also **7-day cooling-off** period applies to purchases made via telemarketing (distance sale),Caller ID **must be displayed** – hiding number is forbidden by regulation. Telemarketers must immediately identify themselves and purpose on call start. No special prefix but consumers can verify numbers via anti-scam apps or 165 hotline,2023: New Digital Communications Act under discussion (to strengthen spam call regulation details TBD). No major changes since earlier Fair Trade guidelines. Taiwan's PDPA (2015) "do-not-call" provisions remain in effect giving individuals the right to reject marketing,2025-08-19,2023-03-02,Medium,Fair Trade Act (ZH) PDPA (ZH) Consumer Protection Act (ZH),**Product Note:** Implement **per-number opt-out tracking**. Agents/scripts must inform consumers of the sales intent and **stop immediately if the consumer expresses disinterest**. Configure dialer to block any number that opted out ("拒絕行銷"). Ensure caller ID is never withheld. Allow call recording especially to capture the agreement for any sale (required to keep as proof). AI calls are not explicitly regulated but all the same rules (identification opt-out option etc.) apply. Err on the side of consent: consider obtaining explicit opt-in for marketing calls when possible due to PDPA's privacy expectations.
Asia,India,IN,Telemarketing to consumers is strictly regulated by TRAI's **Telecom Commercial Communications (Unsolicited Commercial Communications) rules**; prior customer consent and DND compliance are required,Opt-out (Default opt-out via National DND registry; can only call if number not on DND or consumer opted in to your messages),No separate B2B telemarketing law (the UCC regulations apply to calls/messages to subscribers mainly consumers). B2B calls are generally allowed if not to personal numbers,No special opt-in needed for B2B but **if using personal mobile numbers of business contacts treat under consumer rules**,National Customer Preference Register (NCPR) a.k.a. **"Do Not Disturb" registry**,https://www.nccptrai.gov.in (TRAI DND portal),Yes (Registered telemarketers get API/portal access for scrubbing),Yes – **existing relationship does NOT exempt calling a DND-listed number** (unless explicit recent consent obtained separately),**Yes – promotional calls & SMS banned 21:00–09:00** by law. (No marketing calls during the night; only transactional/emergency msgs allowed),Not explicitly about AI. **Automated/prerecorded marketing calls require prior consent** under TRAI rules (treated as promotional calls). No specific disclosure mandated beyond identifying the caller and offering opt-out (e.g. key-press to unsubscribe),Call recording is legal (one-party consent). Many call centers record calls under "service/legitimate interest." No law forces prior consent for recording but disclosing "this call is recorded" is good practice. (Sensitive data recording would invoke data protection obligations under DPDPA),No general ER exemption. **Even if the person is a recent customer you cannot bypass DND rules**. TRAI allows exceptions only if the user has themselves toggled categories to receive certain calls (or given explicit consent via verified means),Transactional calls (order confirmations delivery info) are exempt from "commercial communication" rules if purely service and not promotional. Certain sectors use **promotional category preferences** (e.g. a user might allow bank-related promos but block others). Political survey calls are not covered by TRAI's telemarketing rules but may be subject to Election Commission codes,**Must use designated telemarketer numbers (140xx series)** for all outbound marketing calls. CLI cannot be spoofed; using personal/mobile SIMs for telemarketing is illegal (telcos will disconnect unregistered sources on complaint). All marketing SMS must use registered sender IDs and templates,2023: **Digital Personal Data Protection Act** passed – requires clear consent for using personal data (likely tightening requirements for sharing phone lists). 2022-2024: TRAI implementing blockchain-based consent and header systems (DLT) for messaging; similar tightening for voice may follow. No major changes to call time/DND rules (last overhauled in 2018).,2025-08-19,2025-03-29,High,TRAI UCC Rules (EN) NCPR Portal (EN) DPDPA 2023 (EN),**Product Note:** **Absolutely integrate the DND list**: scrub every outbound number against India's NCPR. Only dial via registered telemarketer IDs and on **140xx numbers**. Enforce time-of-day rules (no promotional dialing between 9pm–9am India time). Implement category-based opt-outs if applicable (TRAI allows users to opt in to some categories and out of others). Obtain express consent (digitally or in writing) for any automated or bulk calling campaigns – TRAI mandates recent (within 3 months) consent for commercial calls. Recording calls isn't mandated but keep logs and recordings of consent where possible (for compliance defense). AI voice agents can be used but they must follow all rules: use approved caller ID state the business identity at start and include an opt-out (e.g. "Press 9 to unsubscribe") in the script.

Asia,Pakistan,PK,Telemarketing to consumers is addressed by PTA directives: consumers can opt out of promotional calls/SMS via the **Do Not Call Register** (since 2010s). Unsolicited marketing without consent is discouraged by the regulator,Opt-out (default allows calls but consumers can **register on DNCR to refuse telemarketing**),No specific B2B telemarketing laws known. B2B communications are generally not restricted (unless personal mobile numbers are targeted),Opt-out (not formally required but advisable to honor requests even in B2B contexts),Do Not Call Register (DNCR),No public website; opt-out via SMS "reg" to 3627 (PTA service),Unknown (Likely no public API; DNCR handled by telecom operators internally),Yes – if a number is on DNCR **it must not be contacted** even if it's your customer,Not officially specified. Common practice is to avoid calling during late night. (No codified quiet hours law but maintaining ~09:00–21:00 calling window is recommended),No specific requirement. (AI or automated calls are generally treated as "telemarketing communication" – presumably must follow same opt-out rules; fully automated calls may be viewed cautiously by PTA),One-party consent (no law prohibiting recording if one party to call). Recording is not widely regulated – but any recorded data should be kept secure. It's polite to inform. **Government may require disclosure if call content is sensitive** (e.g. political),No formal ER exemption. If a customer's number is on DNCR you cannot legally telemarket to them. Companies should maintain internal do-not-call lists as well. Transactional calls to existing customers (e.g. service updates) are allowed,Messages from charities or political campaigns are not explicitly covered by the DNCR (the DNCR is aimed at "telemarketing-related messages"). PTA's focus is on commercial promotions. Also truly "transactional" service calls aren't considered telemarketing. **Note:** Enforcement is via carrier filtering and user complaints so compliance relies on telecom cooperation,No special caller ID or prefix system (unlike India). Telemarketers often use regular mobile or landline numbers; PTA warns operators to curb **SPAM CLI** and allows users to block unknown numbers via *420#. (Product should ensure valid Pakistani numbers are displayed; best practice: use identifiable numbers and avoid frequent number changes),2021: PTA bolstered anti-spam measures – launched *420# blocking service and publicized DNCR opt-out widely. A new personal data protection bill is pending (could require consent for direct marketing if enacted). As of 2025 DNCR remains the main tool.,2025-08-19,2021-01-28,Medium,PTA DNCR Guidelines (EN) PTA Anti-Spam Measures (EN),**Product Note:** Enable **Pakistan DNCR compliance**: do not contact numbers that have opted out via 3627 (telecom operators likely filter such numbers – nonetheless maintain your own list of numbers to avoid). Provide a clear opt-out method in any message or call. It's advisable to get **opt-in consent** especially for bulk campaigns as Pakistan may introduce data protection soon. Limit call times to business hours/local daytime to avoid complaints. Monitor PTA guidelines – they sometimes issue new spam-control directives (e.g. forbidding masking of identities or requiring telemarketer registration). Automated/AI calls should be used sparingly and always include identification and opt-out (to avoid being flagged as spam).
Asia,Bangladesh,BD,Unsolicited marketing calls/SMS are discouraged by BTRC. **"Do Not Disturb" (DND) services** exist via mobile operators for consumers to block promos. No specific telemarketing law but general consumer protection against harassment applies,Opt-out (consumer can dial codes to opt out of promotional communications; no nationwide list that telemarketers query – it's handled by carriers),No B2B-specific rules. Telemarketing to businesses is not separately regulated,No formal regime; treat as opt-out if individuals' numbers are used,"Do Not Disturb" service (per carrier per user),N/A (USSD codes per operator: e.g. *121*1101# for GP),No (each mobile operator filters for its subscribers),N/A (if a user has activated DND with their carrier promotions are blocked by the carrier – marketers should exclude those users from campaigns),None defined in law. Calls at night may be considered **nuisance**. Best practice: restrict marketing calls roughly to 09:00–20:00 local time,Not specified. (AI/automated calls are rare; any pre-recorded spam calls would fall under BTRC's anti-spam guidelines but no explicit requirement to label as AI),One-party consent (no specific law requiring dual consent for call recording). Companies should adhere to privacy norms – advise customers if recording. Any personal data collected via calls falls under data protection policy (draft law pending),No explicit ER exemption. **If a customer opts out via their carrier's DND the business must stop promos** to them. Otherwise existing customers can be contacted for similar products *within reasonable bounds* but must stop if they complain. (The draft data protection law is expected to include a right to object to direct marketing),Operators' own marketing messages are subject to DND (and many complaints are about mobile network promo SMS). Government or emergency alerts aren't considered "marketing." Overall **exceptions are minimal** – telemarketing is generally treated uniformly. (**Note:** Enforcement is currently low; compliance relies on customer complaints to BTRC.),No special telemarketer number series. Calls come from normal mobile or landline numbers. BTRC instructs operators to remind users about DND options monthly. CLI spoofing is illegal (general anti-fraud provisions) but no dedicated caller ID rules for telemarketers,2021: BTRC formally launched the DND initiative across all mobile operators. In 2022–2023 draft Data Protection Act was under review (which may introduce consent requirements for using personal contact info). No new dedicated telemarketing law yet.,2025-08-19,2021-04-25,Medium,BTRC DND Guidelines (EN) Draft Data Protection Act (EN),**Product Note:** Rely on Bangladesh's carrier-level DND: if possible **obtain lists or API from carriers to scrub out DND-activated numbers** (currently each operator may handle internally – so as a precaution include an opt-out mechanism in every call/SMS and honor any opt-out request directly). Keep calls to reasonable hours. Be aware spam complaints can lead BTRC to direct operators to cut off your numbers. Aim to get explicit consent from users (e.g. via forms or SMS) before marketing calls especially as data privacy laws evolve. AI calls are not common in BD – if used ensure they clearly identify the business and provide a way to connect to a human or opt out.
Asia,Sri Lanka,LK,No specific telemarketing law but **Consumer Affairs Authority Act** and **Data Protection Act 2022** provide general safeguards. Direct marketing using personal data likely requires consent or opportunity to opt out under the new privacy law,Opt-out/Depends (Data Protection Act gives individuals the right to object to direct marketing; companies should honor opt-outs. No national DNC registry),No distinct B2B regulations. Telemarketing targeting businesses is generally permissible. The 2022 privacy law applies only to natural persons' data not to company contacts,Opt-out (if personal data of individuals is used). Pure B2B communications (company lines) face no specific restriction,None (No Do Not Call list in Sri Lanka),N/A,N/A,N/A (must respect individual opt-out requests though per general law),Not codified. Industry practice is to avoid late-night calls. (Telecom self-regulations might advise standard business hours; e.g. 08:00–20:00),Not specifically. (No requirement to announce an AI caller. Automated unsolicited calls would likely fall under "electronic communications" needing consent in DPA but person-to-person AI agent would be unregulated as of now),One-party consent legally (no law requires informing the other party of recording). Still best practice under DPA: inform if recording since it's personal data. Many call centers do play a recording notice for quality compliance,No explicit existing-customer exemption in law. Marketers should obtain consent from customers for marketing or at least give a clear opt-out. (An "existing relationship" alone doesn't override the consumer's rights under general law),If the call is purely informational (not marketing) it's not restricted. Political campaign calls charity calls are not addressed by current laws and generally permissible. The Data Protection Act focuses on **"commercial" use of personal data** – so nonprofit communications may not be affected,No specific caller ID or prefix rules. Telemarketers often use regular phone numbers. The regulator (TRCSL) has addressed call spoofing as part of fraud prevention but not specific to telemarketing. It's good practice to display a number and not withhold CLI,2022: Personal Data Protection Act enacted – effective 2023/24 – introduces obligations for consent and fair processing in direct marketing (first such framework in SL). As of 2025 no dedicated DNC registry or telemarketing-specific regulations have been implemented.,2025-08-19,2022-03-25,Medium,Data Protection Act No. 9 of 2022 (official gazette) (EN),**Product Note:** Implement basic **opt-out handling**: allow Sri Lankan recipients to easily opt out of future calls (and honor that in your system). Given the new privacy law it's safest to use **consent-based marketing** – i.e. call people who have agreed or not objected after notice. Train agents to immediately comply if a person says they don't want marketing. Keep call times to normal hours. Because no official DNC exists err on side of caution: perhaps avoid repeatedly cold-calling non-customers. Keep an eye on any consumer protection updates – if telemarketing nuisances rise regulations could be introduced. AI voice calls should follow the same norms as human calls (clear identification etc.).
Asia,Nepal,NP,No specific telemarketing legislation identified. Telemarketing is minimal; any marketing calls must still comply with general consumer protection (avoid harassment) and any applicable privacy principles (Nepal has draft privacy legislation),Opt-out (de facto – since there's no formal regime companies should honor any do-not-call requests from consumers),No B2B telemarketing rules. B2B calls are generally free from regulation in Nepal,Opt-out (no requirement but advisable to apply consumer courtesy to business contacts too),None,N/A,N/A,N/A,None defined. Best practice: restrict calls to daytime/business hours to avoid complaints,Not specified (no known requirement to announce AI usage),One-party consent (Nepal law does not require both parties' consent to record). However recording without a party's knowledge could be viewed negatively if challenged under privacy or wiretap provisions. Safer to inform at least in welcome message,Not applicable (no formal exemption needed as no specific law). If someone you called objects you should mark and avoid calling again as a matter of good practice,N/A – no known exceptions beyond regular practice (e.g. government/public safety calls aren't marketing). Essentially all unsolicited sales calls are tolerated unless they become harassment,No special caller ID rules. Using a recognizable number is recommended. (Nepal Telecom and Ncell have not implemented distinct prefixes for telemarketers),No recent changes. Nepal Telecom Authority has focused on spam SMS control and quality of service. As of 2025 no DNC registry or new telemarketing law.,2025-08-19,N/A,Low,(No official sources found – based on regional comparison and NTA communications),**Product Note:** **No clear legal framework** – proceed conservatively. Always allow recipients to opt out and maintain an internal list of "do-not-call" requests. Limit call frequency to avoid being flagged for nuisance. If Nepal enacts its data protection law (draft pending) expect a consent/opt-out requirement for using personal numbers. Until then apply basic etiquette: identify your company on calls offer a way to decline future calls and stick to local business hours. AI calls: since unregulated ensure they aren't mistaken for scams – perhaps open with a statement and route to human on request.
Asia,Bhutan,BT,No known telemarketing-specific laws. Telemarketing is not common; any practices would be governed by general provisions (e.g. Personal Data Law if enacted and consumer protection from harassment),Opt-out (de facto – no formal opt-in regime but companies should stop if individual objects),No B2B rules; B2B calls are fine,Opt-out (courtesy-based),None,N/A,N/A,N/A,None defined. Use common sense (e.g. 09:00–20:00),No,Likely one-party consent (no law prohibiting recording). Bhutan's privacy framework is limited; recording is generally allowed but should be disclosed if content is sensitive,N/A,N/A,No,Mongolia is considering stronger privacy laws but as of 2025 no DNC or telemarketing rules. No changes.,2025-08-19,N/A,Low,(No specific sources – inference from Mongolia's legal environment),**Product Note:** Very little formal guidance. If engaging in telemarketing in Mongolia follow best practices: get prior permission where possible introduce yourself clearly and keep an internal list of anyone who says stop. Given the lack of rules telemarketing could be seen as unusual – a gentle personalized approach is key. Keep volumes low to avoid prompting regulatory attention. AI calls are untested – if used make them sound as natural and polite as possible or prefer live agents.
Asia,Maldives,MV,No dedicated telemarketing laws known. Marketing calls would fall under general consumer protection and the new Data Protection Act (2021) which requires consent for processing personal data,Opt-in/Consent likely required for unsolicited marketing under privacy law (Data Protection Act) – though enforcement is nascent,No B2B telemarketing rules. B2B calls are generally unregulated (privacy law covers personal data only),Opt-in not required for pure B2B context (ensure the number isn't personal),None,N/A,N/A,N/A (but companies should maintain opt-out lists in line with global best practices),None codified. Avoid late night calls (common sense; small community norms),Not specified,One-party consent (no specific law against recording if one party is part of call). Best practice to inform at least via IVR that call may be recorded,No formal exemption. Even for existing customers best to get consent or at least ensure they haven't objected (per Data Protection Act requirements for direct marketing),N/A – no documented exceptions. Political campaign calls might be subject to electoral guidelines but no telemarketing rules per se,No known caller ID or prefix requirements. Use a local recognizable number for better response. (Maldives telecom providers do not distinguish telemarketing lines),2021: Data Protection Act came into force – likely covers direct marketing consent (modeled after GDPR). No reports of a DNC registry or new telcom regulations as of 2025.,2025-08-19,2021-07-01,Low,(Data Protection Act 2021 (MV) – unofficial summary),**Product Note:** Given the new privacy law treat Maldives as **opt-in territory**: do not cold-call individuals without prior consent. If calls are made ensure you have a lawful basis (preferably consent). There's no DNC list so manage opt-outs internally. Because the market is small unsolicited calls can cause brand damage quickly. Focus on consent-based outreach (e.g. customers who signed up). AI calls are untested here – use with caution and clearly identify the caller to avoid confusion or hang-ups.
Asia,Indonesia,ID,Telemarketing to consumers is subject to **general privacy law (Personal Data Protection Act 2022)** and sectoral regulations (e.g. OJK for financial marketing). No central DNC registry; consent is the emerging norm under the new PDP law,Opt-in (implied by PDP Act – explicit consent is required to use personal data like phone numbers for marketing). Traditionally opt-out in practice (many cold calls happen) but new law leans toward consent,No explicit B2B telemarketing rules; if calling individuals at businesses PDP law still applies to their personal data,No formal regime; in practice B2B marketing calls are common and not specifically regulated but prudent to apply PDP consent if personal info is used,None,N/A,N/A,N/A (must honor individual refusal per PDP – individuals can withdraw consent at any time),No specific legal hours. Generally avoid calling outside 09:00–21:00. (The ICT Ministry could issue guidelines in future),Not yet specified. (No known requirement to identify AI callers; however outright automated robocalls may fall under unwanted communications rules in the EIT Law),One-party consent for recording is generally accepted. However recording and storing call content requires compliance with PDP security requirements. Companies typically inform at the start ("this call will be recorded") especially in finance sector,No explicit ER exemption in law – even existing customers' data cannot be used for new marketing unless it falls under original purpose or you obtain fresh consent. Some tolerance exists if it's a related product but legally safer to treat as no exemption,Certain types of calls are not considered "marketing" – e.g. collection calls purely informational service calls. Those are permitted without consent for that specific purpose. Otherwise little in the way of exceptions; all promotional calls are covered by data protection and consumer laws,No special telemarketer caller IDs. Regulators encourage carriers to label spam calls (via apps or network) but no prefix. Caller ID must not be spoofed (prohibited by law due to fraud concerns),2022: PDP Act enacted – companies must now **have consent** to process personal data for direct marketing. Enforcement is ramping up. No DNC registry introduced yet. OJK in 2023 warned financial institutions against aggressive telemarketing – indicating tighter supervision.,2025-08-19,2022-10-17,Medium,Personal Data Protection Act No.27 of 2022 (ID) (ID) OJK Guidelines (EN),**Product Note:** After Indonesia's PDP law **do not cold-call without prior consent**. You should obtain clear consent (e.g. web form tick box) before calling Indonesian consumers. Maintain proof of consent for each contact. Ensure a privacy notice is given (if calling agents should mention how you got their number). For any call lists you had pre-law consider running a re-consent campaign. Timing: stick to local business hours. Train agents for polite handling – unwanted calls can be reported to Kominfo or Consumer Protection. Use of AI voice: not specifically banned but given low public familiarity it could be poorly received – if used immediately allow option to speak to a human. Keep recordings secure and document consent withdrawal promptly.
Asia,Malaysia,MY,Telemarketing to consumers is governed by the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA) – which requires consent (or notice & opt-out) for direct marketing using personal data. No national DNC list but industry self-regulation exists,Opt-in/Opt-out hybrid: PDPA Section 43 gives individuals the right to prevent processing for direct marketing. In practice **consent or at least notification with opt-out** is required before marketing calls,No specific B2B telemarketing law; PDPA does not apply to business contact information used for business purposes (only personal data of individuals),No consent needed for B2B context under PDPA (unless calling someone's personal number). Ethical opt-out if requested,None (no centralized DNC registry; companies rely on PDPA's opt-out rights),N/A,N/A,N/A (must cease if individual opts out with the company per PDPA Sec. 43),No legal hours specified. Industry practice avoids calls before 9am or after 9pm. The Customer Service Code (voluntary) suggests reasonable hours,Not explicitly mandated. (No law requiring AI self-identification. Automated/prerecorded marketing calls would likely fall under PDPA consent requirement similarly),One-party consent. Businesses commonly record calls (for QA) without separate consent allowed under Malaysian law. However since recordings contain personal data PDPA obligates proper notice purpose limitation and security,No special exemption. If someone is an existing customer you still must comply with PDPA notice/consent unless it's *strictly related to the product they bought*. Many companies include a PDPA consent clause in customer forms to cover future marketing,Service-related calls (e.g. appointment reminders) are not "marketing" and are allowed without separate consent. Political and charitable calls are outside PDPA (which covers commercial context). PDPA only applies to personal data – so truly anonymous marketing (cold-calling random numbers without personal info) is a grey area but not common practice,No specific caller ID rules for telemarketers. Usually calls originate from mobile or fixed numbers. The MCMC has encouraged truthful CLI and taken action on scam call CLI spoofing but no dedicated prefix like "+AD" exists. Always display a number; do not spoof,No recent changes specific to telemarketing. PDPA amendments are under discussion (to strengthen enforcement) but not yet passed as of 2025. MCMC has been cracking down on scam calls which indirectly pressures legitimate telemarketers to be more transparent.,2025-08-19,2019-02-01,Medium,PDPA 2010 (EN) PDPA 2010 Sect.43 (EN),**Product Note:** Ensure **PDPA compliance**: you should have either explicit consent or have provided a privacy notice with an opt-out opportunity *before* calling Malaysian individuals. If you haven't your calls could be unlawful. A practical approach is to send an email/SMS asking permission or include consent in web sign-ups. Always allow opt-out (like an internal DNC): if someone says "don't call" mark it and don't call again. Time your calls considerately. Although no formal DNC list the PDPA opt-out right functions similarly – be ready to delete or suppress data of anyone who objects to marketing. Keep call logs to show compliance (in case of complaints to PDPC). AI voice use: permissible but ensure it follows PDPA (the call content is personal data processing); it's wise to have the AI state which company it represents and offer a human fallback.
Asia,Singapore,SG,Telemarketing to consumers is tightly regulated by the **Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)** and a robust **Do Not Call (DNC) registry**. Sending telemarketing messages or calls requires checking DNC and including certain disclosures,Opt-out (PDPA's DNC provisions let consumers opt out by registering; senders must **scrub against DNC**. Consent is required if contacting a number on DNC or if not checking DNC),B2B calls are generally exempt from DNC rules **if** purely to business contact numbers for business-related marketing. (PDPA DNC covers messages to Singapore telephone numbers "addressed to individuals"),No opt-in needed for genuine B2B context. **However** if calling a person's mobile (even for business) it's safer to treat under PDPA and check DNC unless you confirm it's not a personal number,**Do Not Call Registry** (covers calls SMS fax),https://www.dnc.gov.sg,Yes (API and bulk lookup available via PDPC),Depends – **Existing relationships do NOT exempt you from DNC checks**. However if you have the individual's clear consent you may send despite DNC (consent overrides DNC),Allowed calling times not set by law (self-regulation suggests reasonable hours like 09:00–21:00). Avoid late night/early morning to comply with general consumer protection (harassment),Yes/Depends – If using a fully automated voice system PDPC guidelines require **clear identification** of sender. No specific requirement to say "I am a bot" but must not deceive. Likely "Depends" (no explicit AI law yet),By law you **must** specify your organization name and contact (either during call or shortly after) for telemarketing. Recording is one-party consent (legal). If recording contains personal data it's governed by PDPA (you must protect it and not misuse). Often companies announce recording for transparency,No general exemption. **Even customer numbers must be checked against DNC unless you have documented consent**. PDPC allows organizations to obtain "express consent" to bypass DNC – e.g. a customer ticking a box "I agree to calls" – which then permits calls even if they're on DNC,Pure service calls (e.g. password reset calls) aren't "telemarketing". Likewise survey or market research calls are excluded if no selling involved. The DNC registry specifically covers marketing of goods/services. Non-commercial and transactional messages are exempt,Caller ID must not be concealed. There's no special prefix but many marketing calls originate from mobile-prefix numbers which recipients often distrust. Under new anti-scam measures telemarketers using overseas routes must use "[+]-prefix" (this is for all overseas calls). Locally the new requirement (2023) is that spoofed local numbers are forbidden – use the number assigned to you. **In short:** use a valid SG number and don't mask CLI,2022: Significant enforcement for DNC violations (fines issued). 2023: Introduction of the "+65" prefix for incoming overseas calls to combat spoofing (affects call presentation). PDPA amendments in 2021 enhanced penalties. No new exemptions; DNC scheme remains largely same since 2014.,2025-08-19,2021-02-01,High,PDPA (EN) PDPC DNC Guidelines (EN) PDPC Advisory Guidelines on DNC Provisions 2021 (EN),**Product Note:** **Must integrate SG's DNC registry**. Before any call or text to a Singapore number check if it's on DNC (unless you've obtained explicit consent within the last *likely* 12 months – PDPC recommends refreshing consent). Maintain records of consent (in case of audit). Include the organization's name and contact in call or immediately after (legal requirement). Ensure caller ID is displayed; ideally use a Singapore number to avoid "[SPAM?]" labeling. If an agent or AI reaches voicemail they should state the organization and callback info to comply with PDPC rules. Timing: stick to local waking hours to avoid "nuisance" interpretations. AI voice usage is allowed but if you use a prerecorded message **provide a way to opt-out (e.g. "press 9 to be removed")** in the call.
Asia,Thailand,TH,Telemarketing to consumers is constrained by the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA effective 2022) which requires consent for most direct marketing and consumer protection laws against nuisance. A draft law to establish a DNC registry has been discussed but not yet enacted,Opt-in (PDPA generally requires consent to use personal data for marketing calls unless another legal basis applies which is rare for unsolicited calls),No specific B2B telemarketing law; communications to company contacts are not explicitly regulated (PDPA covers individuals' data only),No formal requirement (tolerated). Still advisable to honor opt-out requests even in B2B context,None (proposed "No-Call" list is not in force yet),N/A,N/A,N/A (must cease contacting any individual who withdraws consent or objects per PDPA rights),No statutory quiet hours. Avoid late-night calls (there have been public complaints pushing authorities to consider time restrictions). Best to stick to ~08:00–20:00,Not explicitly mandated. (No current law on AI caller disclosure. However using automated dialers with recorded messages might fall under spam call rules – regulators have warned against scam robocalls),One-party consent is legal. Call recordings containing personal data must be protected per PDPA. Companies usually notify during the call if recording (to be safe under PDPA's transparency principle),No official ER exemption. A company's existing customer can be called **only if** the call falls under the scope they originally consented to or it's related to an ongoing service. Otherwise need fresh consent. (Marketing to existing customers without prior opt-in is risky under PDPA),Government informational calls (e.g. public health) aren't considered marketing. Apart from that **virtually no exceptions** – any commercial promotion triggers PDPA. The telecom regulator NBTC has separate rules for prize promotion calls/SMS (lottery scams) but those outlaw fraud rather than allow exceptions,No dedicated caller ID rules for telemarketers yet. The National Telecom Commission has encouraged carriers to label spam numbers and introduced a prefix "<ADV>" tag for SMS marketing. For calls new measures in 2023 require telecom operators to display a "Scam warning" on suspicious call numbers. Telemarketers should use numbers registered in their company name; avoid frequent number changes (could be flagged),2022: PDPA fully enforced – companies fined for unsolicited marketing without consent. 2023: Authorities floated creation of a DNC registry and tighter rules after consumer outcry about spam calls – still in progress. Expect more guidance from PDPC on direct marketing in coming years.,2025-08-19,2022-06-01,Medium,PDPA B.E.2562 (2019) (TH) Thai PDPC Guidance (EN summary),**Product Note:** Treat Thailand as **consent-required**. Ensure you have explicit opt-in (e.g. checked box "I agree to be contacted") before cold-calling a Thai individual. Keep proof of consent. Without consent you risk PDPC penalties. Implement internal suppression: if anyone says they didn't consent or asks not to be called stop immediately and log it. Monitor legal developments – a formal DNC list may appear; if so integrate it. Use clearly identified phone numbers (matching your company) for calls – this builds trust and avoids being auto-flagged. AI calls: Use cautiously; Thais have been hit with scam robocalls so an unfamiliar AI voice might be mistaken for a scam. If you do use an AI consider a Thai-language intro that it's an automated call from Company X and offer a human agent option.
Asia,Philippines,PH,Telemarketing is subject to the **Data Privacy Act 2012** (which requires consent or at least fair processing notice for direct marketing) and consumer protection rules on unwanted communications. No nationwide DNC registry exists yet,Opt-in (implied by Data Privacy Act – organizations should have consent to use personal info for marketing calls; at minimum an opt-out mechanism must be provided if they rely on legitimate interest),No specific B2B provisions. Marketing to companies is generally unrestricted unless personal data is involved,No formal regime; generally permitted,None,N/A,N/A,N/A (must honor any opt-out request an individual makes – NPC expects companies to keep "do not contact" lists),No official hours in law. The Department of Trade and Industry endorses calling during reasonable hours only. Recommend 09:00–18:00 for cold calls,Not explicitly. (No law forcing AI disclosure. However telesales calls must always identify the company and purpose whether AI or human),One-party consent. Many call centers record without separate consent (allowed). The NPC advises transparency if calls are recorded as voice recordings are personal data. Safer to inform at start for privacy compliance,No explicit ER exemption. If the person didn't opt in being a customer doesn't automatically allow marketing calls. However if they provided their number during a transaction some companies assume "legitimate interest" for similar offers – this is a gray area; NPC would likely favor explicit consent for marketing,Non-commercial calls (surveys political) aren't covered by the marketing consent requirement of DPA. But fraudulent/spoof calls are separately illegal. Otherwise all promotional calls must follow privacy principles,No special telemarketer caller ID rules. Often calls come from mobile numbers. Telecoms have implemented caller ID tagging for spam (some networks show "Spam Likely"). The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) has regulations against caller ID spoofing (to combat scams) but no prefix system for marketing,No major recent changes. A "NO CALL NO TEXT" bill to create a DNC list has been proposed in Congress multiple times (most recently 2023) but not yet passed. NPC continues to issue warnings to companies about unsolicited contact without consent.,2025-08-19,2018-03-00,Medium,Data Privacy Act IRR 2016 (EN) NPC Advisory on Direct Marketing 2017 (EN),**Product Note:** Operate under the assumption of **consent required**. Ideally call only those who have opted in via web forms etc. If you must cold-call ensure you give a proper privacy notice in the call (who you are how you got their number if asked and that they can opt out). Immediately cease calling a number if the person objects – and add it to an internal DNC list. Be mindful the Philippines is very sensitive to scam calls; using an AI voice might confuse people – better to use a live agent for initial contact. Keep call times to business hours. Stay alert for a potential DNC law; if one passes compliance (scrubbing against it) will become mandatory.
Asia,Mongolia,MN,No known telemarketing-specific laws. Telemarketing is not common; any practices would be governed by general provisions (e.g. Personal Data Law if enacted and consumer protection from harassment),Opt-out (de facto – no formal opt-in regime but companies should stop if individual objects),No B2B rules; B2B calls are fine,Opt-out (courtesy-based),None,N/A,N/A,N/A,None defined. Use common sense (e.g. 09:00–20:00),No,Likely one-party consent (no law prohibiting recording). Bhutan's privacy framework is limited; recording is generally allowed but should be disclosed if content is sensitive,N/A,N/A,No,Mongolia is considering stronger privacy laws but as of 2025 no DNC or telemarketing rules. No changes.,2025-08-19,N/A,Low,(No specific sources – inference from Mongolia's legal environment),**Product Note:** Very little formal guidance. If engaging in telemarketing in Mongolia follow best practices: get prior permission where possible introduce yourself clearly and keep an internal list of anyone who says stop. Given the lack of rules telemarketing could be seen as unusual – a gentle personalized approach is key. Keep volumes low to avoid prompting regulatory attention. AI calls are untested – if used make them sound as natural and polite as possible or prefer live agents.

You can call consumers but due to public pressure Monaco will likely adopt stricter rules soon. It's advisable to apply French standards: scrub against the Bloctel DNC list (even though not legally required) and follow French calling hours. Always display a caller ID. Be especially careful to avoid aggressive or scam-like practices as Monaco is scrutinizing telemarketing and preparing new regulations.
Europe,San Marino,SM,B2C: Likely opt-out (no evidence of an opt-in law).

(In practice treating existing client calls as less restricted is reasonable – e.g. service calls or upsells to current customers are generally acceptable unless they opted out),No specific exemptions known. Non-commercial calls (e.g. purely informational calls satisfaction surveys) would not fall under "marketing" and thus face no special rule,No local caller ID rules. It's advisable to show a valid number and follow Italy's lead on prefix usage (Italy now assigns special prefixes for telemarketing calls) to avoid call blocking,San Marino has no recent telemarketing reforms of its own. However Italy's 2022–2023 measures (extending DNC to mobile introducing call prefixes) influence best practices. SM is expected to align informally but no new law in 2024,2025-08-19,Law 171/2018 (SM) Italian RPO Influence (IT context),Note: San Marino's framework is derived from general privacy law (Law 171/2018) rather than telemarketing-specific statutes. In absence of local rules we apply EU/Italian standards. Treat all cold calls with an opt-out mentality – e.g. integrate Italy's RPO list if possible to avoid calling those who opted out in Italy. Limit call times to reasonable hours. No special compliance for AI calls beyond obtaining consent if using automated dialing/voices. For recording get the person's consent or notification to stay within privacy norms.
Europe,Andorra,AND,B2C: Opt-out (assumed) – Andorra has no dedicated telemarketing law publicly available. Direct marketing falls under data protection rules.

There is no formal opt-in requirement for calls so an opt-out approach applies. Always offer the recipient an easy way to refuse future calls. Because there's no DNC list maintain an internal do-not-call list for Andorra. Adhere to GDPR principles: you should have a legitimate interest basis for cold calls and must stop if the person objects. No special rules for AI voices or call recording beyond standard privacy obligations – if recording calls announce it and secure consent to be safe.
