Implement internal suppression: if anyone says they didn't consent or asks not to be called stop immediately and log it. Monitor legal developments – a formal DNC list may appear; if so integrate it. Use clearly identified phone numbers (matching your company) for calls – this builds trust and avoids being auto-flagged. AI calls: Use cautiously; Thais have been hit with scam robocalls so an unfamiliar AI voice might be mistaken for a scam. If you do use an AI consider a Thai-language intro that it's an automated call from Company X and offer a human agent option.",
