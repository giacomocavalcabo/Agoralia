# Prompt Engineering Guidelines

## Best Practices

1. **Clear and Specific Instructions**
   - Be explicit about what you want
   - Provide context and constraints
   - Use examples when helpful

2. **Structure and Format**
   - Break down complex requests
   - Use consistent formatting
   - Include relevant details

3. **Common Patterns**
   - "Show me the code for..."
   - "How do I implement..."
   - "What's wrong with this code..."
   - "Help me debug..."

4. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Start broad, then narrow down
   - Build on previous responses
   - Ask for clarification when needed

5. **Context Management**
   - Maintain conversation context
   - Reference previous discussions
