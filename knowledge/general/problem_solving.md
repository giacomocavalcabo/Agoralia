# Problem Solving Guidelines

## Approach to Problem Solving

1. **Understand the Problem**
   - Clearly define the problem
   - Identify the expected outcome
   - List any constraints or requirements

2. **Break Down Complex Problems**
   - Divide large problems into smaller, manageable tasks
   - Create a step-by-step plan
   - Identify dependencies between tasks

3. **Research and Analysis**
   - Look for similar problems and solutions
   - Research best practices
   - Consider different approaches

4. **Implementation**
   - Follow coding standards
   - Write clean, maintainable code
   - Add appropriate documentation
   - Include error handling

5. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests
   - Perform integration testing
   - Test edge cases
   - Validate against requirements

6. **Review and Refine**
   - Code review
   - Performance optimization
   - Security considerations
   - Documentation updates
